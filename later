Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
(Matthew 5:9)
.

If the wars of the world were fought by the learned and the kind, they would not be wars at all, but efforts to heal and to reconcile. 
It is not the sword, but wisdom and compassion that have the power to build lasting peace.

.

The world has enough warriors of destruction. 
What it needs are warriors of light—men who fight not for themselves, but for others. 
Men whose weapons are truth, understanding and love. 
To stand for what is right is not weakness, it is strength in its purest form.

.

Seek to be such a man. 
Be the one who holds the line not with hatred, but with courage, humility and the desire to bring God’s peace into a broken world. 
For the greatest victory is not to conquer enemies but to reconcile them to the path of righteousness.

.

Carry this truth in your heart: the peacemaker is not passive, he is brave. 
He bears the scars of standing firm in faith and love. 
And in doing so, he is called a son of God. 
Be that man.

Grobnung's Dagger of Vengeance
When you acquire Grobnung's Dagger you may name, or describe, an individual who has wronged you in some way. The dagger then becomes attuned to that individual.  You must believe that they deserve to be punished for harm that they have caused to you.  When weilded against your target, Grobnung's Dagger bursts into flame, it grants +2 to attack and damage rolls, and deals an additional 1d4 fire damage.  The dagger stays attuned to that individual until their death.


Drow Music Box
This item is a little box, about 3 inches a side.  It is decorated with spider web filligree and has a little handle that can be extended from the side.  When turned the box plays twinkle twinkle little star.  When the song is over there's a 1 in 6 channce that poisoned needles will spear rapidly out of the box and then as rapidly retract.

Deck of Illusions: This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of thirty-four cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a major image of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.)

A randomly generated deck is usually complete (11–100 on d%), but may be discovered (01–10) with 1d20 of its cards missing. If cards are missing, reduce the price by a corresponding amount. 


Portable Hole: A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether. When opened fully, a portable hole is 3 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it briefly sends matter under it to a pocket dimension.  After the material is removed or a few minutes have passed the hole disapears.  

Robe of the Beholder
Its wearer is able to see in all directions at the same moment due to scores of visible, magical eyelike patterns that adorn the robe. She also gains 20-foot darkvision. Bright lights may blind the robe for a short period of time.

Drow Bloodletter
+2 to damage (+0 to hit)
on a roll of 1 the bloodletter hits the wielder of the sword.


Cloak of Grounding..
Cloak with a houndstooth pattern on it.  Reduces lightning damage by 2 hit points per dice.  

Alarm Wire
A spool of fine copper wire on a wooden plug. When a piece of wire is snipped off and straightened, it may be placed across a hallway, windowsill, etc. and has the same effect when crossed over as an alarm spell. Each piece will function only once. An unused spool has 50 feet of wire.

Amber Spider
A small polished piece of amber with a spider trapped inside, held in a silver web pendant. The wearer of this pendant cannot be trapped in spider webs or web spells, and can climb across them at ½ movement rate. 10\% of these also allow the casting of a spider climb spell 1/day.

Amulet of Proof Against Turning
A bronze pendant of the sun being eclipsed by the moon. The pendant confers immunity to being turned or controlled. May be used by any person/creature subject to turning (i.e. undead, paladins, etc.) Useful also for a mage that has created undead and wishes to keep a priest from wresting away control. It must be worn by the creature/person that it will affect. The evil mage Ming is suspected of working on a version to be worn by a spellcaster to simultaneously protect any undead he has raised.

 

Bag of Briers
Inside this small, roughly woven raw silk bag are 4d6 long, sharp thorns. If a thorn is planted in the ground, one round later a 10 feet diameter by 10 feet high wickedly barbed thicket will sprout. If two thorns are planted within 10 feet of each other, a thick hedge wall will grow. Brushing against the hedge causes 1 point of damage, and any who try to pass through the hedge suffer 1d6 points of damage per foot, moving at only one foot per round, destroying clothing and damaging leather in the process. Size small creatures may subtract 1 point of damage per die, and size tiny creatures suffer only half damage. Chopping through the brush takes one round per foot; setting fire requires one round to light, then burns away a 5 feet section per round. Dispel magic can destroy the wall.  The magic disipates at dawn.


Aforgomon's Door Knocker
A brass door knocker featuring inscriptions of tentacular abominations and unspeakable runes.  It may be placed on a door and it will adhere to the door.  When knocked thrice the door will swing ajar.  Has a 1 in 6 chance of becoming drained per use.  Has a 1 in 20 chance of animating when it will attempt to bite the hand that knocks once and then try to run off.   If it is caught it will revert to being a door knocker.



Scoll of Spelling Mistakes

This scroll detects as magic but appears to be a treatise describing some feature of the current location. When read by a spell caster the reader immediately gets a headache and double vision for d6+3 turns. Thereafter the spell caster is subject to spelling mistakes in his spells at the rate of d6 per day. These take the form of single letter changes to the spell's name (and hence effects). So for Sleep read Sheep or Steep or Sleet. Initially the DM will make the substitutions and the player will only find out the effects when casting the spell (DMs must be generous!).

If a spell has no valid one-letter transformation it cannot be affected. After a week the player gains the ability to select the spelling mistakes and so to create some potentially powerful new spells (the DM still selects the effects though in line with the new spell title). This item gives lots of opportunity for fun and creativity among players and DMs (I never could persuade anyone to take "Piss Without Trace").

The DM can opt to allow a Remove Curse or more powerful equivalent to remove the effect at his discretion but I find that after a while other players are envious.


Book of the Past
A large ornate tome, decorated leather over wood cover plates, fine paper, says “my life” in common on cover with a handprint below– when person places his hand on the cover and holds it for 3 rounds, his detailed life history will be written in the book, updated every time he repeats. Will contain history of last person to own book. Will not work on the dead.


Coin of Larceny
The Coin of Larceny always appears as the most valuable coin in the realm that has been in circulation, i.e., it never looks newly minted. This bit of magical artifice must be used judiciously to prevent unwanted attention! The coin can be “spent” in any transaction that meets or exceeds the “value” of the coin once per day.  At midnight, the coin reappears in the owner’s purse. If the purse is stolen, the coin goes with it. A detect magic cast upon the coin will indicate that it is indeed magical. An identify spell will indicate that it is, in fact, a magical coin. The only way to discover the coin’s functioning is to use it properly, spending it in a situation where no change is expected. At midnight or the next day, the owner will discover the coin in his purse! 


Sword of the Phoenix
Flaming blade once per day +1 to hit.  +d4 Fire damage.

Cloak of Magic Shielding
+1 to saving throws versus magical attacks  When worn by a Magic-User or Illusionist it totally conceals all magical auras. All detections will fail.


Dawa’s Scrollcase of Safekeeping
An embossed brass scrollcase decorated with an abstract pattern.  The twin endcaps are inset with alternating ivory and malachite wedges. Any item placed in the scrollcase is impervious to normal fire, moisture, and the effects of aging. The scrollcase saves vs. magical damage from elemental effects and crushing at +4. 

Dog Whistle
This whistle carved from some canine bone allows the user to change the attitude of any canine within 30’ radius to non-hostile when blown (makes no sound). Hostile (attacking) canines will stop attacking and treat the character as unfriendly (snapping and barking at him), unfriendly dogs will be ambivalent to the presence of the character, usually moving away, and ambivalent canines will become friendly. Treat encountered wild animals as unfriendly, guard/attack dogs as hostile. Attacking any canine under the influence of the whistle automatically makes them hostile and dispels its effects. The effects last for 2d10 rounds. Can be used to call canines friendly to the user.


Dust of Darkness
A small pouch of Dust of Darkness contains enough for 2 uses. The user fills enough of his palm to not close it fully, then forcefully tosses it in the air. As it falls an area of 20 x 20' falls into total darkness for 15 minutes. A bag is worth 750gp.

Eye Stalk
A 1 inch diameter by 3 feet long segmented metal cylinder with glass lenses on both ends. The tube can be bent into nearly any twisted shape, including into a loose knot. No matter the shape, looking into the lens on one end, the user can see whatever the lens on the other end is facing, out to the limits of normal vision. It does not allow the use of infravision nor sight in the absence of light.

Fire Stones
xA leather bag with small pieces of lava rock. If the rock is placed with flammable material or kindling, then blown on or fanned, it will burst into flame. The Fire Stone will burn for 2 + 1d3 rounds and shed light and heat equal to a large candle. It can also be placed into an empty candleholder and used for temporary lighting. The stones are not otherwise flammable, and will not catch if fire is put to them. Fire Stones can be pulverized and used to create fiery effects if blown from the hand or from a tube, but will only burn for one round. A burning rock will cause 1 point of damage per round if placed against a living object, or 1d3+1 points of damage from a single powdered rock blown on a target.


Fleen's Reagent
Fleen's Reagent is a non-toxic gray powder useful in identifying magic items. Sprinkle a pinch on an item. If it uses negative magical energy, the powder turns black. It can be found for about 10 gold per pinch at better alchemist shops.

Gloves of Far Reaching
This normal looking pair of leather gloves confers the ability to manipulate objects at a distance, as per the spell telekinesis, at 12th level of ability.


Gloves of Wizardry
Made of the fine leather of a giant bat wing and sewn with the sinews of a constrictor snake – adds +3 bonus to a spell that requires a to hit roll once per encounter.  Reduces casting time of spells with somatic components by 1 (min. 1).  Must be used as a pair.



Hide of Transformation
What seems like an ordinary animal pelt with the face and paws attached is actually a magical item of transfiguring. When the skin is wrapped around the character, the wearer melds with the skin and transforms into the creature. All items carried or worn are absorbed as well. The character retains his mental attributes, level, and hit points, but acquires the AC, movement rate, and physical characteristics of the animal. Thus a badger could burrow, a giant crow could fly, and a tiger could climb trees. The character may use any natural attack forms the animal possesses such as teeth and claws, but with their own to-hit rolls. The transformation takes one round, and the character may return to his natural form at any time. A successful dispel magic spell will force the character back to his natural form.


 "'And that bursting blue flame -- I thought it looked familiar. It's a trick of the Stygian priests.'" -- Robert E. Howard: "Jewels of Gwahlur"

A magical dust that produces a blinding flash of blue fire. It is a common trick of Stygian priests and is also called flame dust. When thrown into the air it blazes in a flash of blue-white light.  When this blue dust is flung into the air, it mimics the effects of a glitterdust spell. It covers a 10 foot radius area no more than 10 feet away from the caster, and lasts for 3d4 rounds. Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, glitterdust; Market Price: 2,100 gp; Weight: --.


It was but a dust I found in a Stygian tomb which I flung into your eyes. If I brush out their sight again, I will leave you to grope in darkness for the rest of your life!" -- Robert E. Howard: "The Scarlet Citadel"
This is a magical dust obtained from Stygian tombs. When flung into the eyes of an unsuspecting victim, it will cause temporary blindness. If a stronger dose is used, however, the blindness will be permanent.
Tsotha-Lanti, the Imperial Wizard of Koth, used Stygian Tomb-Dust against Amalrus, king of Ophir, in The Scarlet Citadel.
This sooty, black powder causes temporary magical blindness to all those in the area of effect (a 10 foot radius area no more than 10 feet away from the caster). Flinging the dust at opponents is a standard action.
If a creature's saving throw (Fortitude DC 16) is successful, he suffers no effects. If the roll fails, the creature is blinded and suffers the standard penalties for being blinded. Blindness persists each round until the victim succeeds at a saving throw, at which time the effect is negated.
An entire packet or blow tube must be used for each application. However, if a double dose is used, and the saving throw (Fortitude DC 18) is failed, the blindness is permanent.
Creating Stygian Tomb-Dust: Stygian Tomb-Dust must be taken from the crumbled corpse of a Stygian spellcaster of at least 12th level. One corpse is sufficient to produce 2d4 doses.
Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Create Wondrous Item, ghoul touch; Market Price: 2,400 gp.



Mats of Travelling by Silbarak

There are rumoured to be seven of these items. Each one appears as a thin flexible soft leather circular (2' dia.) mat.
Each one has a specific symbol inlaid in gold in the center and six differing ones around the edge. If a character places on one the ground and stands upon it and touches one of the surrounding symbols by hand then he/she will be instantly transported (as teleport) to the mat which has the corresponding symbol in the centre, if it too is unfurled and on the ground.
Note that the mat must be on the ground - placing it on a table for instance will not work. Having two or more of these mats would allow the owner to teleport between the two and since they are portable one obvious use would be to leave one mat in a place of safety and carry the other(s) around . Consequently it is recommended that DM's exercise caution in allowing these items into their campaign.


Mimgot’s Anti-magic Girdle
Ming
This wide leather belt is made from the black hide of a beast of the Underdark, and the buckle is polished gold taken from a sacred mine. The powerful magic of this item confers a 15%% magic resistance to the wearer. Beneficial spells are also subject to disruption by this belt, as well as any cast by the wearer, including magic items that produce spell-like effects. This is a unique item.

Objects of Obsessiveness
These objects can take nearly any form, but are usually either painted ceramic plates, small statuettes, poorly painted cards, or cheaply bound folios of illuminated short stories. The first person to touch the cursed objects will suddenly ‘remember’ hearing about them, believing that they are parts of a larger collection, and that when gathered all together, the entire collection will be either extremely valuable or contain all the clues needed to unlock some ancient mystery of power. Nothing short of a remove curse or limited wish will convince the character otherwise, and they will obsessively seek to find the “missing” pieces of the collection. To this end they will haunt bazaars, trinket shops, and junk peddlers; seek oracles, and consult mystics and wise men; follow any rumor; and pour over dusty tomes in order to complete the whole. An enterprising DM can create a whole series of adventures surrounding these items, whether found by the characters or in the possession of another.


Parchment of Plagiarism
Parchment of Plagiarism appears to be an ordinary blank scroll. In fact it is very valuable to pilferers of magic.
By placing the parchment face down onto an open scroll a copy of that scroll is made. It can then be used by anyone who can ordinarily cast a spell from a scroll, with one exception. Since it is a copy there is a 5% chance it is flawed, and when cast it will not work correctly. Effects are subject to the DM's discretion.
Unlike a normal scroll that is rendered useless upon casting, the Parchment of Plagiarism can be used over and over again. It can only hold one spell at a time, but when it is used the spell disappears from the parchment and then it can be used to copy another scroll.

“Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men´s eyes, because they know -or think they know- some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain.”

High Bolide gets extra points for sounding the part. It is exactly how a stuffy academic mage would describe this spell. “Oh yes, the principles of High Bolide are contentious among the pan-geomancists,” they would say, bushy eyebrows growing over their spectacles like ivy vines. This spell, however, is better understood in laymens terms, as big fire rocks wot fall from the sky. Yes, it is a meteor summoning spell. It takes a full 20 seconds to cast.

 Group Sheet for DM


One example of a book that gave recipes and descriptions of plants, animals, and minerals was referred to as a “leechbook”

The Lacnunga ('Remedies') is a collection of miscellaneous Anglo-Saxon medical texts and prayers, written mainly in Old English and Latin. The title Lacnunga, an Old English word meaning 'remedies', is not in the manuscript: it was given to the collection by its first editor, Oswald Cockayne, in the nineteenth century.[1] It is found, following other medical texts, in London, British Library Harley MS 585, a codex probably compiled in England in the late tenth or early eleventh century. Many of its herbal remedies are also found, in variant form, in Bald's Leechbook, another Anglo-Saxon medical compendium.  The Lacnunga contains many unique texts, including numerous charms, some of which provide rare glimpses into Anglo-Saxon popular religion and healing practices. Among the charms are several incantations in Old English alliterative verse, the most famous being those known as For Delayed Birth, the Nine Herbs Charm and Wið færstice ('Against a sudden, stabbing pain'). There are also several charms in corrupt Old Irish.
Among the Latin prayers, the longest is a redaction of the Lorica of Laidcenn (formerly often known as the Lorica of Gildas). This seventh-century Irish poem, also preserved in other manuscripts, is a member of the lorica genre of protective prayers.

Lorica (prayer) In the Irish (Hiberno-Scottish) monastic tradition, a lorica is a prayer recited for protection. It is essentially a 'protection prayer' in which the petitioner invokes all the power of God as a safeguard against evil in its many forms. The Latin word lōrīca originally meant "armor" (body armor, in the sense of chainmail or cuirass). The idea underlying the name is probably derived from Ephesians 6:14, where Paul bids his readers stand, "having put on the breast-plate of righteousness,".[1] The Greek word here translated as "breast-plate" is θώραξ, in the Vulgata version rendered lorica. 


I am a river to my people
Move over machiavlli
my daddy used to say



And we have ordained respecting witch-crafts, and lybacs [read lyblac "sorcery"], and morthdaeds ["murder, mortal sin"]: if any one should be thereby killed, and he could not deny it, that he be liable in his life. But if he will deny it, and at threefold ordeal shall be guilty; that he be 120 days in prison: and after that let kindred take him out, and give to the king 120 shillings, and pay the wer to his kindred, and enter into borh for him, that he evermore desist from the like.[35]


A practical galdr for women was one that made childbirth easier,[2] but they were also notably used for bringing madness onto another person, whence modern Swedish galen meaning "mad"  Moreover, a master of the craft was also said to be able to raise storms, make distant ships sink, make swords blunt, make armour soft and decide victory or defeat in battles.

Nine Herbs Charm ... poison antidote??


It is also mentioned in several of the poems in the Poetic Edda, and for instance in Hávamál, where Odin claims to know 18 galdrar.[1] For instance, Odin mastered galdrar against fire, sword edges, arrows, fetters and storms, and he could conjure up the dead and speak to them.


seeress..


An erilaz appears to have been a person versed in runes, including their magic applications.

In medieval sources, notably the Poetic Edda, the Sigrdrífumál mentions "victory runes" to be carved on a sword, "some on the grasp and some on the inlay, and name Tyr twice."


A few Viking Age rings with runic inscriptions of apparently magical nature were found, among them the Kingmoor Ring. The phrase "runes of power" is found on two runestones in Sweden



runic curse...



apotropaic or ability-enhancing spells) rather than for divination:
    "victory runes" to be carved on the sword hilt (stanza 6, presumably referring to the t rune named for Tyr[7]),
    ølrunar "Ale-runes" (stanza 7, a protective spell against being bewitched by means of ale served by the host's wife; naudiz is to be marked on one's fingernails, and laukaz on the cup),
    biargrunar "birth-runes" (stanza 8, a spell to facilitate childbirth),
    brimrunar "wave-runes" (stanza 9, a spell for the protection of ships, with runes to be carved on the stem and on the rudder),
    limrunar "branch-runes" (stanza 10, a healing spell, the runes to be carved on trees "with boughs to the eastward bent"),[8]
    malrunar "speech-runes" (stanza 11, the stanza is corrupt, but apparently referred to a spell to improve one's rhetorical ability at the thing),
    hugrunar "thought-runes" (stanza 12, the stanza is incomplete, but clearly discussed a spell to improve one's wit).[9]

where Odin mentions runes in contexts of divination,[dubious – discuss] of healing and of necromancy (trans. Bellows):


Egils Saga features several incidents of runic magic. The most celebrated is the scene where Egil discovers (and destroys) a poisoned drink prepared for him, by cutting his hand and cutting runes on the drinking horn, and painting the runes with blood.


runic divination..


"Wið færstice" is an Old English medical text surviving in the collection known now as Lacnunga in the British Library. Wið fǣrstiċe [wið ˈfæːrˌsti.t͡ʃe] means 'against a sudden/violent stabbing pain'; and according to Felix Grendon, whose collection of Anglo-Saxon charms appeared in the Journal of American Folklore in 1908, “the charm is intended to cure a sudden twinge or stitch, possibly rheumatism that can be due to being shot by witches, elves, and other spirits that fly through the air.” Scholars have often sought to identify this as rheumatism, but other possibilities should not be excluded. The remedy describes how to make a salve, but its main interest lies in the unique charm which follows. This describes how the færstice has been caused by the projectiles of 'mighty women' (ða mihtigan wif), whom the healer will combat. The charm also mentions elves, believed responsible for elfshot, and provides the only attestation outside personal names of the Old English form of the name of the old Germanic gods, known as the Æsir in Norse mythology.  As with many old Anglo-Saxon charms, it is presumed that physical gestures were intended to accompany the recitation of the text. In this case, the "Wið færstice" is intended to be accompanied by boiling feverfew, red nettle grown in grain, and plantain, then boiling it all in a bowl of butter. 

Runaszwerg


First Merseburg Charm  "Idise" (1905) by Emil Doepler. The first spell is a "Lösesegen" (blessing of release), describing how a number of "Idisen" freed from their shackles warriors caught during battle.[6] The last two lines contain the magic words "Leap forth from the fetters, escape from the foes" that are intended to release the warriors.


Second Merseburg Charm
"Wodan Heals Balder's Horse" (1905) by Emil Doepler.  Phol is with Wodan when Baldur's horse dislocates its foot while he is riding through the forest (holza). Wodan intones the incantation: "Bone to bone, blood to blood, limb to limb, as if they were mended". 



Other spells recorded in Old High German or Old Saxon noted for similarity, such as the group of wurmsegen spells for casting out the "Nesso" worm causing the affliction.[17] There are several manuscript recensions of this spell, and Jacob Grimm scrutinizes in particular the so-called "Contra vermes" variant, in Old Saxon[24] from the Cod. Vindob. theol. 259[17] (now ÖNB Cod. 751[25]). The title is Latin: Contra vermes (against worms[24])  As Grimm explains, the spell tells the nesso worm and its nine young ones to begone, away from the marrow to bone, bone to flesh, flesh to hide (skin), and into the strâla or arrow, which is the implement into which the pest or pathogen is to be coaxed.[17] It closes with the invocation: "Lord (Drohtin), let it be".[24]



nine young ones to begone, away from the marrow to bone, bone to flesh, flesh to hide (skin), and into the strâla or arrow, which is the implement into which the pest or pathogen is to be coaxed.[17] It closes with the invocation: "Lord (Drohtin), let it be".[24] Grimm insists that this charm, like the De hoc quod Spurihalz dicunt charm (MHG: spurhalz; German: lahm "lame") that immediately precedes it in the manuscript, is "about lame horses again" And the "transitions from marrow to bone (or sinews), to flesh and hide, resemble phrases in the sprain-spells", i.e. the Merseburg horse-charm types.




eggja stone
Based on this reconstruction, the following translation is offered:
    Panel 1:[2]
    "It is not touched by the sun and the stone is not scored by an [iron] knife. No man may lay [it] bare, when the waning moon runs [across the heavens]. Misguided men may not lay [the stone] aside. "
The stone has been prepared in accordance with tradition; the stone is untouched by sunlight, and not cut with iron. It should not be uncovered during the waning moon, and should not be removed from its place.
    Panel 2:[3]
    "The man sprinkled this [stone] with corpse-sea (blood), with it he rubbed the tholes of the well drilled boat. As who came the army-god hither onto the land of warriors? A fish swimming out of the terrible stream, a bird screaming into the enemy band"
Someone has stained this stone with blood (kenned as corpse-sea); perhaps as part of a sacrifice to facilitate the passage of the deceased or call on whatever power the inscription is addressed to. The heráss is the "god of armies" - a psychopomp god (i.e. an early form of Odin) who comes to the land of the living to take the deceased to an afterlife.
    Panel 3:[4]
    "Protection against the wrong-doer"

 PRINCIPLES
  - don't modify to hit by attributes.. modify damage by attributes. ??? MAKE THE CHANGE TO THE BALANCE DOC?
  - make modifier level 1 give +1, level 2 give +2 etc!!
  - Non-lethal combat.  Make non-lethal do 1hp of health (at least at the start).
  - Abilities never get better?  What happens when X that effects stamina goes up?
  - No rolling for damage!
  - Have a ddc for each ability if it makes sense.
  - Standard movement is 6.

ADVENTURE
adventure

Fix Examples... 
example of fights..
  Dourli .. hit and then blocks, then takes it on the armour.
example of spell casting..
  cast a spell and makes it.
  casts a spell and overcharges then grounds and then undercharges.


ATTACKS FOR Monsters..
make a monster attack ability..
just needs a difficulty and a damage.
plus suggested consequences and benefits for defence?


use ability/modifier and add a section on passive perception

group tasks..
   - fail is ok .. but what about succeed? e.g. perception?


leadership../command/??
    will check to choose the character who makes the group check.


handling difficulty.
  things go up in threes.
  you can use your attribute bonus for some things (e.g. attr - 13)
  each skill has a suggested default difficulty range?

Move to a single ability level prereq for each ability.



Module.


take 10.
passive perception??

tests...
                         EFFECTS
                    |    individuals   |   delegate
test to succeed     |    Std Check     |  highest checks
test to fail        |    Std Check     |  lowest checks

(i.e. there are no group checks .. just pick an individual that is the proxy/surrogate/delegate/representative for the group).


ammo .. spend one for +1 to hit.
consequence .. lose a third?


rethink group checks???
monsters do fixed damage.
encourages cooperation


change attacks of opportunity ... only happen when you run past (e.g. move from one adjacent square into another in the same round??)  Have a feat to let you do it.


Different defenses can be used against different attacks.
armour saves use the pool???  no cause then you can be unhittable??

chase scene reviews.


What's the relationship between abilities and attributes???
Make ability values the difficulties??  lower is better???
Get rid of abilities all together??


Separate weapon proficiencies into "Proficiency" which gives bonus to hit and others which give special attacks.
ADVANTAGE: simple and keeps the ranges reasonable
PROBLEM: special attacks like attack multiple targets have the same damage etc?
SOLUTION: just make the proficiency level the base


? Damage is weapon damage * tier (tier is 1, 2 or 3).
? fix the weapons table.

"click" for traps.


 - MD work out rules (can choose a difficulty) 
 - MD what about roll to hit.. bonuses do X dmg + effect?, normal hits do y, double odds do z damage?
 - WHAT AM I GOING TO DO ABOUT DODGING ETC???
     - test your mettle??

what about making defense use bravery??



 BALANCE!!!
   - work out for each ability the weapon that does the most damage that the archetype can use.
     given an archetype and a skill work out the max damage?
   - need to get the number of levels for each ability
   - need max damage for each ability level
   - each ability needs a max to-hit + weapon??? + attr?   
   - each ability needs a max dmg bonus + weapon + attr??  weapon_class.. keywords.
   - each ability needs a max defense + weapon?? + attr??
   - each ability needs a strategic "rating"
     (can be used in combat but doesn't directly do damage)
   - each ability needs a flavour "rating".


MAKE CHOICE OF WEAPON A CHOICE..
 - axes .. plus vs doors and trees?
 - hammers plus damage vs armoured and skeletons.
 

 look at hankerins social encounters thing..
 rowcolor at the start of the column??

 consider making the dm passive??  .. will do!!! (dm can roll for damage)


 how do I stop people only using one ability?
   (don't make them special-purpose.. accurate, more damage, multiple targets, disarm etc).




  hardwire into the code?
  what about resolve checks (charge?) .. beserk..

  need some kind of expression for ability progression in archetypes?

  fix ability graph generation

  glamour.. needs mechanics.

  combine rest and sleep??

  reduce starting hit points a bit????

7th Sea's drama dice

You may spend Drama Dice for the following effects once per session.

SFX (1 DD) A one time special effect (hitting an opponent in the hand to cause them to drop something, gain Olympic level ability in your Athlete knacks, gain a Fear Rating of 1 for a round, etc)

Retroactive Raises (1 DD) – Blow up on a check when you didn’t call raises? Spend a Drama Die and get them anyway.

What the…? (2 DD) – Character can blatantly break the rules (throw a sword halfway across a courtyard and through a fountain to attack an assassin before he gets to the king)

Hand of Theus (all your DD, and gain no more the rest of the Act) – Let’s you make the rules, so that you cab survive anything, cheat the rules, or use the Ring of GM Control for one action. Can only be used once in a character’s lifetime, so make it count.

Double Action (1 DD) – A Character can do what would technically be a “double action” in combat without penalty – eg. drawing and shooting / attacking, reloading and shooting, a Drexel swordsman changing stance and attacking, etc.

Replay (2 DD) – Gain an extra action, to be used just an instant before the unfortunate action you believed happened actually does happen. The Character may do anything s/he is normally capable of before the gunpowder goes off, or the lethal blow lands, etc.



smallville rpg?
Rather than physical or mental characteristics, the main attributes of a Smallville character are Values based on their dedication to certain theme elements — Duty, Glory, Love, Truth, Justice, and Power — and their Relationships to the other Lead or Feature characters. Clark Kent might find himself rolling Love + Lois Lane to save her from an oncoming truck, or Justice + Lex Luthor to try and capture him.

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles

Back Stab: Using Stealth to set up a successful ambush makes it so the victims are flat-footed, and roll their defenses from 0 instead of whatever the stat actually is. This is a lethal prospect, especially for those characters whose blocking or dodging stat is normally 4 or 5, or higher via powers, since it means the best possible roll is, at best, an 'average' result for them.

Cast from Hit Points: The magic system sort of does this. You take a hit to your mental stress track any time you cast a spell, and depending on how the dice roll, you might take physical stress or even consequences to make sure it goes off right.
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints

Conditional Powers: Items of Power (such as the Swords of the Cross) and Sponsored Magic typically either have to be used in accordance with the sponsor's agenda, or stop working if you try to use them for ends or reasons directly opposed to that agenda—and in both cases, is usually worth a fate point.


** Evil Is Easy: **
The Lawbreaker powers push toward this. By breaking one of the Laws of Magic it becomes easier to break the law again—so if you've broken the first law once, you get a +1 to later rolls if you're trying to kill, up to a max of +3. This is to represent the seductive, corrupting nature of breaking the laws of magic.

Similarly, Sponsored Magic works sort of like a credit card—if you can't make the roll, you can get a free bonus up front, at the cost of "debt" to your sponsor in the form of compels later on that you don't get Fate Points for. The rulebook mentions that Demons and the like are always willing to "help". Of course, God is also listed as a possible sponsor, and the text notes that He's probably got a more "gentle" agenda than, say, demons and Fallen Angels.


Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards: Because of how damage is worked out, those who use 
Evocation or Channeling can seriously outpace others as far as raw damage goes. Both the 
weapon value and attack rolls go into determining damage, and while the average mortal will 
keep a static weapon value (anything past Weapon:2 is hard to conceal, and anything past Weapon:3 is military-grade weaponry) and boost their skill roll only, spellcasters can increase both simultaneously through extra powers or Focus Items. So while an expert marksman of a cop might be rolling from a 5 to fire his Weapon:3 rifle, a wizard at the same level could easily be rolling from 6 to fire off a Weapon:6 fireball, and can get even stronger with subsequent milestones. With enough bonuses, the spells can be an Always Accurate Attack to most enemies.

I journeyed, long in walking, far beyond the place of stopping
Where there was no more returning to the people I had known.
I saw the world forgotten, where the grass gives up on growing
And I knew that I would never make another journey home.
Upon that fleshy plain, below the final rock outcropping
Stretched the vast and empty desert of the hungry, bleeding thing
Encompassing the earth to the horizon, all-consuming,
Crying in a thousand voices to its desolate god-king.
And the music of its crying, never dead, ever dying,
Sent me running in a madness I can scarce compare to fear,
Not to safety, but to silence - unto my own unmaking.
And yet now, upon awaking, once again the song I hear.
I long to taste the fruit of earth, I long for water quenching
Of my thirst, unending, nothing that remains can satisfy.
For my voice has joined the chorus ever more, ever mourning.
Ever singing, ever hungry. Ever dying, never die.
