“Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men´s eyes, because they know -or think they know- some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain.”

"Do not speak to me of the dark magic I was there when it was written."


“It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.”

 Group Sheet for DM


One example of a book that gave recipes and descriptions of plants, animals, and minerals was referred to as a “leechbook”

The Lacnunga ('Remedies') is a collection of miscellaneous Anglo-Saxon medical texts and prayers, written mainly in Old English and Latin. The title Lacnunga, an Old English word meaning 'remedies', is not in the manuscript: it was given to the collection by its first editor, Oswald Cockayne, in the nineteenth century.[1] It is found, following other medical texts, in London, British Library Harley MS 585, a codex probably compiled in England in the late tenth or early eleventh century. Many of its herbal remedies are also found, in variant form, in Bald's Leechbook, another Anglo-Saxon medical compendium.  The Lacnunga contains many unique texts, including numerous charms, some of which provide rare glimpses into Anglo-Saxon popular religion and healing practices. Among the charms are several incantations in Old English alliterative verse, the most famous being those known as For Delayed Birth, the Nine Herbs Charm and Wið færstice ('Against a sudden, stabbing pain'). There are also several charms in corrupt Old Irish.
Among the Latin prayers, the longest is a redaction of the Lorica of Laidcenn (formerly often known as the Lorica of Gildas). This seventh-century Irish poem, also preserved in other manuscripts, is a member of the lorica genre of protective prayers.

Lorica (prayer) In the Irish (Hiberno-Scottish) monastic tradition, a lorica is a prayer recited for protection. It is essentially a 'protection prayer' in which the petitioner invokes all the power of God as a safeguard against evil in its many forms. The Latin word lōrīca originally meant "armor" (body armor, in the sense of chainmail or cuirass). The idea underlying the name is probably derived from Ephesians 6:14, where Paul bids his readers stand, "having put on the breast-plate of righteousness,".[1] The Greek word here translated as "breast-plate" is θώραξ, in the Vulgata version rendered lorica. 


I am a river to my people
Move over machiavlli
my daddy used to say



And we have ordained respecting witch-crafts, and lybacs [read lyblac "sorcery"], and morthdaeds ["murder, mortal sin"]: if any one should be thereby killed, and he could not deny it, that he be liable in his life. But if he will deny it, and at threefold ordeal shall be guilty; that he be 120 days in prison: and after that let kindred take him out, and give to the king 120 shillings, and pay the wer to his kindred, and enter into borh for him, that he evermore desist from the like.[35]


A practical galdr for women was one that made childbirth easier,[2] but they were also notably used for bringing madness onto another person, whence modern Swedish galen meaning "mad"  Moreover, a master of the craft was also said to be able to raise storms, make distant ships sink, make swords blunt, make armour soft and decide victory or defeat in battles.

Nine Herbs Charm ... poison antidote??


It is also mentioned in several of the poems in the Poetic Edda, and for instance in Hávamál, where Odin claims to know 18 galdrar.[1] For instance, Odin mastered galdrar against fire, sword edges, arrows, fetters and storms, and he could conjure up the dead and speak to them.


seeress..


An erilaz appears to have been a person versed in runes, including their magic applications.

In medieval sources, notably the Poetic Edda, the Sigrdrífumál mentions "victory runes" to be carved on a sword, "some on the grasp and some on the inlay, and name Tyr twice."


A few Viking Age rings with runic inscriptions of apparently magical nature were found, among them the Kingmoor Ring. The phrase "runes of power" is found on two runestones in Sweden



runic curse...



apotropaic or ability-enhancing spells) rather than for divination:
    "victory runes" to be carved on the sword hilt (stanza 6, presumably referring to the t rune named for Tyr[7]),
    ølrunar "Ale-runes" (stanza 7, a protective spell against being bewitched by means of ale served by the host's wife; naudiz is to be marked on one's fingernails, and laukaz on the cup),
    biargrunar "birth-runes" (stanza 8, a spell to facilitate childbirth),
    brimrunar "wave-runes" (stanza 9, a spell for the protection of ships, with runes to be carved on the stem and on the rudder),
    limrunar "branch-runes" (stanza 10, a healing spell, the runes to be carved on trees "with boughs to the eastward bent"),[8]
    malrunar "speech-runes" (stanza 11, the stanza is corrupt, but apparently referred to a spell to improve one's rhetorical ability at the thing),
    hugrunar "thought-runes" (stanza 12, the stanza is incomplete, but clearly discussed a spell to improve one's wit).[9]

where Odin mentions runes in contexts of divination,[dubious – discuss] of healing and of necromancy (trans. Bellows):


Egils Saga features several incidents of runic magic. The most celebrated is the scene where Egil discovers (and destroys) a poisoned drink prepared for him, by cutting his hand and cutting runes on the drinking horn, and painting the runes with blood.


runic divination..


"Wið færstice" is an Old English medical text surviving in the collection known now as Lacnunga in the British Library. Wið fǣrstiċe [wið ˈfæːrˌsti.t͡ʃe] means 'against a sudden/violent stabbing pain'; and according to Felix Grendon, whose collection of Anglo-Saxon charms appeared in the Journal of American Folklore in 1908, “the charm is intended to cure a sudden twinge or stitch, possibly rheumatism that can be due to being shot by witches, elves, and other spirits that fly through the air.” Scholars have often sought to identify this as rheumatism, but other possibilities should not be excluded. The remedy describes how to make a salve, but its main interest lies in the unique charm which follows. This describes how the færstice has been caused by the projectiles of 'mighty women' (ða mihtigan wif), whom the healer will combat. The charm also mentions elves, believed responsible for elfshot, and provides the only attestation outside personal names of the Old English form of the name of the old Germanic gods, known as the Æsir in Norse mythology.  As with many old Anglo-Saxon charms, it is presumed that physical gestures were intended to accompany the recitation of the text. In this case, the "Wið færstice" is intended to be accompanied by boiling feverfew, red nettle grown in grain, and plantain, then boiling it all in a bowl of butter. 

Runaszwerg


First Merseburg Charm  "Idise" (1905) by Emil Doepler. The first spell is a "Lösesegen" (blessing of release), describing how a number of "Idisen" freed from their shackles warriors caught during battle.[6] The last two lines contain the magic words "Leap forth from the fetters, escape from the foes" that are intended to release the warriors.


Second Merseburg Charm
"Wodan Heals Balder's Horse" (1905) by Emil Doepler.  Phol is with Wodan when Baldur's horse dislocates its foot while he is riding through the forest (holza). Wodan intones the incantation: "Bone to bone, blood to blood, limb to limb, as if they were mended". 



Other spells recorded in Old High German or Old Saxon noted for similarity, such as the group of wurmsegen spells for casting out the "Nesso" worm causing the affliction.[17] There are several manuscript recensions of this spell, and Jacob Grimm scrutinizes in particular the so-called "Contra vermes" variant, in Old Saxon[24] from the Cod. Vindob. theol. 259[17] (now ÖNB Cod. 751[25]). The title is Latin: Contra vermes (against worms[24])  As Grimm explains, the spell tells the nesso worm and its nine young ones to begone, away from the marrow to bone, bone to flesh, flesh to hide (skin), and into the strâla or arrow, which is the implement into which the pest or pathogen is to be coaxed.[17] It closes with the invocation: "Lord (Drohtin), let it be".[24]



nine young ones to begone, away from the marrow to bone, bone to flesh, flesh to hide (skin), and into the strâla or arrow, which is the implement into which the pest or pathogen is to be coaxed.[17] It closes with the invocation: "Lord (Drohtin), let it be".[24] Grimm insists that this charm, like the De hoc quod Spurihalz dicunt charm (MHG: spurhalz; German: lahm "lame") that immediately precedes it in the manuscript, is "about lame horses again" And the "transitions from marrow to bone (or sinews), to flesh and hide, resemble phrases in the sprain-spells", i.e. the Merseburg horse-charm types.




eggja stone
Based on this reconstruction, the following translation is offered:
    Panel 1:[2]
    "It is not touched by the sun and the stone is not scored by an [iron] knife. No man may lay [it] bare, when the waning moon runs [across the heavens]. Misguided men may not lay [the stone] aside. "
The stone has been prepared in accordance with tradition; the stone is untouched by sunlight, and not cut with iron. It should not be uncovered during the waning moon, and should not be removed from its place.
    Panel 2:[3]
    "The man sprinkled this [stone] with corpse-sea (blood), with it he rubbed the tholes of the well drilled boat. As who came the army-god hither onto the land of warriors? A fish swimming out of the terrible stream, a bird screaming into the enemy band"
Someone has stained this stone with blood (kenned as corpse-sea); perhaps as part of a sacrifice to facilitate the passage of the deceased or call on whatever power the inscription is addressed to. The heráss is the "god of armies" - a psychopomp god (i.e. an early form of Odin) who comes to the land of the living to take the deceased to an afterlife.
    Panel 3:[4]
    "Protection against the wrong-doer"

  - Have a ddc for each ability if it makes sense.
  - Standard movement is 6.

(i.e. there are no group checks .. just pick an individual that is the proxy/surrogate/delegate/representative for the group).


ammo .. spend one for +1 to hit.
consequence .. lose a third?


rethink group checks???
monsters do fixed damage.
encourages cooperation


change attacks of opportunity ... only happen when you run past (e.g. move from one adjacent square into another in the same round??)  Have a feat to let you do it.


Different defenses can be used against different attacks.
armour saves use the pool???  no cause then you can be unhittable??

chase scene reviews.


What's the relationship between abilities and attributes???
Make ability values the difficulties??  lower is better???
Get rid of abilities all together??


Separate weapon proficiencies into "Proficiency" which gives bonus to hit and others which give special attacks.
ADVANTAGE: simple and keeps the ranges reasonable
PROBLEM: special attacks like attack multiple targets have the same damage etc?
SOLUTION: just make the proficiency level the base


? Damage is weapon damage * tier (tier is 1, 2 or 3).
? fix the weapons table.

"click" for traps.

 - MD what about roll to hit.. bonuses do X dmg + effect?, normal hits do y, double odds do z damage?
 - WHAT AM I GOING TO DO ABOUT DODGING ETC???
     - test your mettle??

what about making defense use bravery??



 BALANCE!!!
   - work out for each ability the weapon that does the most damage that the archetype can use.
     given an archetype and a skill work out the max damage?
   - need to get the number of levels for each ability
   - need max damage for each ability level
   - each ability needs a max to-hit + weapon??? + attr?   
   - each ability needs a max dmg bonus + weapon + attr??  weapon_class.. keywords.
   - each ability needs a max defense + weapon?? + attr??
   - each ability needs a strategic "rating"
     (can be used in combat but doesn't directly do damage)
   - each ability needs a flavour "rating".


MAKE CHOICE OF WEAPON A CHOICE..
 - axes .. plus vs doors and trees?
 - hammers plus damage vs armoured and skeletons.
 

 look at hankerins social encounters thing..
 rowcolor at the start of the column??

 consider making the dm passive??  .. will do!!! (dm can roll for damage)


 how do I stop people only using one ability?
   (don't make them special-purpose.. accurate, more damage, multiple targets, disarm etc).




  hardwire into the code?
  what about resolve checks (charge?) .. beserk..

  need some kind of expression for ability progression in archetypes?

  fix ability graph generation

  glamour.. needs mechanics.

  combine rest and sleep??

  reduce starting hit points a bit????

  Change attribute type xsd to a ?

  Get rid of the klazyabolous abilities.. make them special or monster?

    </p>

 PROBLEMS

 - abilities.. (no per character ability stuff).
     - keywords
     - broken down by keyword
     - automation??
     - remove all the parent abilities ... like physical???  make the attribute tests.
     - what do we do about trees and dependencies?

  if I go to keywords how do I organize the trees?
  want to make the trees smaller as well.



 - simplify the bonus system??
 - maths behind the game.
 - fights were all the same.
 - fix level up points.
 - character creation .. simplify
      
 - ability tree complexity?
 - the role of attribute modifiers in abilities
 - pursuit
	no high level spells? (is that a bad thing?)
	breaking??? 
	rests?
	character creation too complicated
	leveling up!
	balance

    Point-buy system.. problematic.
    Equipment prices.. eratic

 - change level up tables to only show changes going up levels??
 - mooks, named characters, key characters. (names?)
 - two shot ability with guns. ?? 
 - double damage ability for fighters?  Triggered on a 88, benefit, double, succesful hit, 
 - double attack ability for fighters?  Triggered on a double ...
 - dilletante
 - rename wilderness and city abilites (sneak etc).
 - physical is broken .. no mastery for tree roots?
 - witchhunter starting points.
 - banish (under powered.. poorly designed)
 - rip out the per class mastery?

 CHECK
    fight-reach.. change to a spear!
    What does FAST and SLOW mean?
    lose resolution???? (maybe keep it?)
    FIXME
  
remove ability group description?
prepared.. right tool for the job.. (ability.. fills a heavy item place). Sound planner?
add level 4 attribute bonuses.





 *** CHANGES ***

plan..
   drop attribute prereqs from (most) abilities. .. prereaattr

versioning!!
Move creation to the archetype sheets


each ability has a list of attributes that are useful for it.
make trees in the ability tree all use the same points... e.g. skullduggery would use general, 


customize npcs

monster layout
encounters

nerf large shield. Reduce AC bonus of large shield to +1.. give them a deny-flank ability instead.

 overcharge in abilities in book
 and effect
 overcharge table.

 bind is op.

 removed necromantic lore and demonic lore.. moved that into the conjuration magic school.
 (should I call it conjuration or demonic lore?)



Reading Scroll make test at the language level .. inochian, fey or possibly dwarven?

Move the tables for bonuses into the character creation fragment!!

rename abilities for hide in towns? Urban/Wilderness





keystone levels?
spells - components, gestures?

ABILITY..
 - Perceive ability goes away (it's very close to a perception check?  .. no leveling up!!)

7th Sea's drama dice

You may spend Drama Dice for the following effects once per session.

SFX (1 DD) A one time special effect (hitting an opponent in the hand to cause them to drop something, gain Olympic level ability in your Athlete knacks, gain a Fear Rating of 1 for a round, etc)

Retroactive Raises (1 DD) – Blow up on a check when you didn’t call raises? Spend a Drama Die and get them anyway.

What the…? (2 DD) – Character can blatantly break the rules (throw a sword halfway across a courtyard and through a fountain to attack an assassin before he gets to the king)

Hand of Theus (all your DD, and gain no more the rest of the Act) – Let’s you make the rules, so that you cab survive anything, cheat the rules, or use the Ring of GM Control for one action. Can only be used once in a character’s lifetime, so make it count.

Double Action (1 DD) – A Character can do what would technically be a “double action” in combat without penalty – eg. drawing and shooting / attacking, reloading and shooting, a Drexel swordsman changing stance and attacking, etc.

Replay (2 DD) – Gain an extra action, to be used just an instant before the unfortunate action you believed happened actually does happen. The Character may do anything s/he is normally capable of before the gunpowder goes off, or the lethal blow lands, etc.



smallville rpg?
Rather than physical or mental characteristics, the main attributes of a Smallville character are Values based on their dedication to certain theme elements — Duty, Glory, Love, Truth, Justice, and Power — and their Relationships to the other Lead or Feature characters. Clark Kent might find himself rolling Love + Lois Lane to save her from an oncoming truck, or Justice + Lex Luthor to try and capture him.

flourish that disheartens/intimidates people (sword to the throat type thing)...
also disarming becomes important .. cause it intimidates as well.

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles

Back Stab: Using Stealth to set up a successful ambush makes it so the victims are flat-footed, and roll their defenses from 0 instead of whatever the stat actually is. This is a lethal prospect, especially for those characters whose blocking or dodging stat is normally 4 or 5, or higher via powers, since it means the best possible roll is, at best, an 'average' result for them.

Cast from Hit Points: The magic system sort of does this. You take a hit to your mental stress track any time you cast a spell, and depending on how the dice roll, you might take physical stress or even consequences to make sure it goes off right.
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints

Conditional Powers: Items of Power (such as the Swords of the Cross) and Sponsored Magic typically either have to be used in accordance with the sponsor's agenda, or stop working if you try to use them for ends or reasons directly opposed to that agenda—and in both cases, is usually worth a fate point.


** Evil Is Easy: **
The Lawbreaker powers push toward this. By breaking one of the Laws of Magic it becomes easier to break the law again—so if you've broken the first law once, you get a +1 to later rolls if you're trying to kill, up to a max of +3. This is to represent the seductive, corrupting nature of breaking the laws of magic.

Similarly, Sponsored Magic works sort of like a credit card—if you can't make the roll, you can get a free bonus up front, at the cost of "debt" to your sponsor in the form of compels later on that you don't get Fate Points for. The rulebook mentions that Demons and the like are always willing to "help". Of course, God is also listed as a possible sponsor, and the text notes that He's probably got a more "gentle" agenda than, say, demons and Fallen Angels.


Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards: Because of how damage is worked out, those who use 
Evocation or Channeling can seriously outpace others as far as raw damage goes. Both the 
weapon value and attack rolls go into determining damage, and while the average mortal will 
keep a static weapon value (anything past Weapon:2 is hard to conceal, and anything past Weapon:3 is military-grade weaponry) and boost their skill roll only, spellcasters can increase both simultaneously through extra powers or Focus Items. So while an expert marksman of a cop might be rolling from a 5 to fire his Weapon:3 rifle, a wizard at the same level could easily be rolling from 6 to fire off a Weapon:6 fireball, and can get even stronger with subsequent milestones. With enough bonuses, the spells can be an Always Accurate Attack to most enemies.
