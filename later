7th Sea's drama dice

You may spend Drama Dice for the following effects once per session.

SFX (1 DD) A one time special effect (hitting an opponent in the hand to cause them to drop something, gain Olympic level ability in your Athlete knacks, gain a Fear Rating of 1 for a round, etc)

Retroactive Raises (1 DD) – Blow up on a check when you didn’t call raises? Spend a Drama Die and get them anyway.

What the…? (2 DD) – Character can blatantly break the rules (throw a sword halfway across a courtyard and through a fountain to attack an assassin before he gets to the king)

Hand of Theus (all your DD, and gain no more the rest of the Act) – Let’s you make the rules, so that you cab survive anything, cheat the rules, or use the Ring of GM Control for one action. Can only be used once in a character’s lifetime, so make it count.

Double Action (1 DD) – A Character can do what would technically be a “double action” in combat without penalty – eg. drawing and shooting / attacking, reloading and shooting, a Drexel swordsman changing stance and attacking, etc.

Replay (2 DD) – Gain an extra action, to be used just an instant before the unfortunate action you believed happened actually does happen. The Character may do anything s/he is normally capable of before the gunpowder goes off, or the lethal blow lands, etc.



smallville rpg?
Rather than physical or mental characteristics, the main attributes of a Smallville character are Values based on their dedication to certain theme elements — Duty, Glory, Love, Truth, Justice, and Power — and their Relationships to the other Lead or Feature characters. Clark Kent might find himself rolling Love + Lois Lane to save her from an oncoming truck, or Justice + Lex Luthor to try and capture him.


new paranoia

flourish that disheartens/intimidates people (sword to the throat type thing)...
also disarming becomes important .. cause it intimidates as well.

SKILL TESTS..

  YOU CAN ONLY USE THE SKILL ONCE.

2) have spells that require ingredients.
3) have spells that require gestures      fa-hand-stop-o (alias) [&#xf256;]

Back Stab: Using Stealth to set up a successful ambush makes it so the victims are flat-footed, and roll their defenses from 0 instead of whatever the stat actually is. This is a lethal prospect, especially for those characters whose blocking or dodging stat is normally 4 or 5, or higher via powers, since it means the best possible roll is, at best, an 'average' result for them.

Cast from Hit Points: The magic system sort of does this. You take a hit to your mental stress track any time you cast a spell, and depending on how the dice roll, you might take physical stress or even consequences to make sure it goes off right.
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints

Conditional Powers: Items of Power (such as the Swords of the Cross) and Sponsored Magic typically either have to be used in accordance with the sponsor's agenda, or stop working if you try to use them for ends or reasons directly opposed to that agenda—and in both cases, is usually worth a fate point.


** Evil Is Easy: **
The Lawbreaker powers push toward this. By breaking one of the Laws of Magic it becomes easier to break the law again—so if you've broken the first law once, you get a +1 to later rolls if you're trying to kill, up to a max of +3. This is to represent the seductive, corrupting nature of breaking the laws of magic.

Similarly, Sponsored Magic works sort of like a credit card—if you can't make the roll, you can get a free bonus up front, at the cost of "debt" to your sponsor in the form of compels later on that you don't get Fate Points for. The rulebook mentions that Demons and the like are always willing to "help". Of course, God is also listed as a possible sponsor, and the text notes that He's probably got a more "gentle" agenda than, say, demons and Fallen Angels.


Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards: Because of how damage is worked out, those who use 
Evocation or Channeling can seriously outpace others as far as raw damage goes. Both the 
weapon value and attack rolls go into determining damage, and while the average mortal will 
keep a static weapon value (anything past Weapon:2 is hard to conceal, and anything past Weapon:3 is military-grade weaponry) and boost their skill roll only, spellcasters can increase both simultaneously through extra powers or Focus Items. So while an expert marksman of a cop might be rolling from a 5 to fire his Weapon:3 rifle, a wizard at the same level could easily be rolling from 6 to fire off a Weapon:6 fireball, and can get even stronger with subsequent milestones. With enough bonuses, the spells can be an Always Accurate Attack to most enemies.

have <gm_only> sections.


flail has a bonus to subdue?


 fast melee dudes
    strings of attacks.

 fail melee 
   rerolls? commander to boost. 

   tags
     tags are labels attached to a character, monster, scenario or world.
     they have no other significance in and of themselves
     they are used as prequisites for skills (and stunts???).


 thieves..
   maybe there are no thieves per se...
   pick locks is ok
   hide in shadows ->?
   backstab?


   skills
     allow you to do special things
     tags are prerequisites

   can be compelled..
   player does what the dm compells or 



Find and Remove Traps
Pick Pockets 
Move Silently
Hide in Shadows
Hear Noise 

morale plus clerics, bards and leaders
high initial chances for climb walls etc.. 17/20

finnesse in magic.. some spells need you to hit the right number d4s?

classes
  melee damage dealer - 1st tier fighter
  tank  - 1st tier fighter
  cleric - 2nd tier fighter
  magic user  
    power vs - 3rd tier fighter
    finesse - 3rd tier fighter

   threshold (beat a number to win)
   graduated threshold (beat by X to succeed with style)
   graduated target number (have to get an in a range).

have a don't .. (just use it pass or fail) field for an ability mastery.

e.g. spider poison->poison.
   

temple of the small gods


thieves get lots of d4s for damage (1s go away)..  they have to be careful where they use them?
advantage, surprise etc gives them rerolls.

 add disabilites (and conditions)
 ability to size up opponent (appraise?)

Build this into the abilities
healing magic is very precise.. overloading is very bad.
magic users overload (sloppy).. clerics are weak but very precise..
druids etc are in the middle (or are they really powerfull?).. other spell casters are sloppy and weak

pupeteers .. type of magic users?

mask makers.. type of monster.  Make masks from peoples faces.
