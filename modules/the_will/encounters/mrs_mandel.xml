      Mrs Mandel will greet them.  Say Elize is not there.  If they want to look around Mrs Mandel is fine by that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mrs Mandel/Pilichins work is done and she/he
      is cleaning up loose ends.    She will go into the cellar where Elize is tied unconscious and lying on
      the floor and set a fire.  The characters will smell the smoke.
      Mr Mandel is dead under some wood in the corner and has been for a few weeks, stabbed in the back and partially
      eaten.
