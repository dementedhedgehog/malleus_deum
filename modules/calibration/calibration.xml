<sectiontitle>Archetype Calibration Encounters</sectiontitle>

<p>
  A list of encounters per level used to calibrate character strength.
  These are single character encounters that a first level character should have
  a reasonable chance of winning.  Combat centric characters ideally would have
  an easier time of these than the combat-lite archetypes.
