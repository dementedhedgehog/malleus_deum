  <details>The characters can attempt to jump over the hole do a Jump check - this is fast.  The character can walk around the edges - this is slow (which are rotten and there's little room between the hole and the walls).  The character can make an agility check and a luck check to reduce the damage.  The characters can use a rope with a grappling hook.. make an easy ropecraft check DC 5 - this is slow.  If unsuccessful and a number of characters use the rope then pick a random character for the rope to fail.</details>
