      Orcs are stupid and aggressive.  Milok will yell out loudly "I haff found der humans!" then he will
      attack until he is killed or his opponents flee.  If his opponents flee he will pursue if he is
      not yet bloodied.  If there's any hesitation Milok says "I am going to kill you with my Choppa!"
      (All Orcs talk like Arnold Schwarzeneggar)

      If the PCs hide use an opposed Perception versus Hide to determine if he dinfs them.
