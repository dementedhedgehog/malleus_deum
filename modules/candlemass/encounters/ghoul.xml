  <precis>Lucia Bianchi has lured the characters into her killing house.</precis>  
  <motivation>Johann Schnee has made some progress on the disappearances.  The Ghoul Cult wants this to stop.</motivation>  
  <progression>Gives the characters the first glimpse of the long term story line.</progression>  
  <difficulty>3xL1 Hard</difficulty>  
  <strategy>Because she regenerates and is fleet Lucia will want to attack and then
  run off for a bit, then repeat.  Lucia wants to get information from them.  She will offer to spare one of them
  for information, will check 4 (she won't spare them).   She will want to know whether they come from Schee, whether he is dead?, and what they know about her.  If things are looking bad for the characters she will ask them about whether they have the black book? and whether they know where the holy lance is?
  <p>    
    Characters who charge her must make an agility check 10 or they get too close to weak floor and fall through.
    If this happens Lucia will call out.. "Don't worry my dear little piggy, Lucia will save you."

  <outs>Yosh Shemenge will alert the city guard who will turn up in the nick of time.</outs>
