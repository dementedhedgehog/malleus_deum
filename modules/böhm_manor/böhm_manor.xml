Ghost story...

Reports that the house is haunted letter from Mary Böhm to Yohann.  He's never heard of her.  They live in another part of town.

characters should rock see a nice looking house in a burned area of the town.
usured in by maid 
greeted by the wife who confides in them about the ghostly sounds she's been hearing  and that her husband would be very angry if he found out about her contacting them

baby starts crying upstairs.. the baby needs food.. the wife informs her that "what we both need is some rest".
wife leaves and says she will be back presently.

maid turns up and offers them some refreshments.

at this point the husband turns up and demands to know who the maid is talking to.

when the characters inform him that they've been talking to his wife he informs them that she was burned to death in the fires.

baby stops crying


run up the stairs to the baby 
the nursery and the main bedroom etc is on the 4th (top) floor.

the baby is swaddled and the wife is suckling it 


the husband can't believe it .. will say "You died.. I saw you die"

the house was actually burned down and the wife, husband, baby and maid were all killed.
the characters will start to notice the small things indicating the house is burned down (and covered by an illusion).

the wife will put the baby down .. it's a burned to death zombie looking thing.
she says "Now shush.. the baby needs rest I keep telling you... but we're hungry .. so very hungry."


ghosts attack...
players will be unable to deal much damage.. damage will just slow the ghosts down.. dissipate them for a round.
walls will slow them down.. one round to move through.
the ghosts will hurl objects at the players using telekinesis.


they'll need to get out of the haunted house because that's the locus of their power.. beyond the house they have no strength.

once out of the house the grounds can be exorcised.

The players can leap out of windows.  falling damage is straight to health and is per story jumped.. it's almost very likely fatal from the fourth floor, likely fatal from the third, and likely to break bones from the second.

after they escape they must make a will check or gain the haunted aspect.  (zone out from time to time in periods of stress.. a bit PTSDy).

if the grounds are searched they will reveal the skeleton of a small baby.. burying it will get rid of the ghosts,

if anyone uses true sight at any time.. they will immediately gain the haunted aspect and see the state of the house and the "people" in it.
