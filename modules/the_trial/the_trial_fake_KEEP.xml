	(old, fat, bouffant, rosacae).   The court is run by <bold>Scribe Ernst
	Hoffman</bold>, (old, wise, bald, pince nez) constantly making suggestions to the
	magister in sotto voce.  There's a jury
	sitting in a box to one side and a crowd of onlookers ready to cheer any pithy comments.
	Courts try half	a dozen cases a day.  

	<!--
