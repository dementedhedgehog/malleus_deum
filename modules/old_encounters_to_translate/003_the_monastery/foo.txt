certainly better than nothing. Therefore a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness.

I know a word of letters three. Add two, and fewer there will be!
(Few)

Say my name and I disappear. What am I?
(Silence)

My life can be measured in hours,
I serve by being devoured.

Fat, I am slow
Wind is my foe.
(A candle)

Gnaws iron, bites steel;
Grinds hard stones to meal;
Slays king, ruins town,
And beats high mountain down.

What begins and has no end? What is the ending of all that begins?
(death)

Pregnant every time you see her, yet she never will give birth.

What question can you never honestly answer yes to?
(Are you asleep? or dead)
