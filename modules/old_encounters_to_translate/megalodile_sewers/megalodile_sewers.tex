\section*{Megalodile Sewers}

\begin{precis}
\item Random sewer encounter
\item Luminous fish in the water
\item The fish scatter 
\item Players attacked by a large crocodile (e.g. pet)
\item Crocodile pg 15 of DMG.. plus extra hit points
\end{precis}

\begin{outs} 
\item The crocodile has had enough and retreats.
\item The players make down a side entrance to the sewers and the megalodile can't be bothered following (easier food to be found elsewhere).
\item Flame drives the thing away (doesn't like the bright lights).
\item Just skip the encounter
\item Go over the wall instead?
\end{outs}

\begin{purpose}
\item Filler
