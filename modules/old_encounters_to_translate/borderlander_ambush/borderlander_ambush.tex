\item Attempt to assassinate the King, Seifrid Nerval.
\item Nerval is travelling by coach from the Palace to one of his country estates.
\item The attack will take place within sight of the Palace walls (so guards are on their way almost immediately.  The reason for the attack taking place close to the Palace is that the carriage drivers take different routes through the city to thwart assassination attempts.  
\item The attack is orchestrated by the Hibernian Princes.
