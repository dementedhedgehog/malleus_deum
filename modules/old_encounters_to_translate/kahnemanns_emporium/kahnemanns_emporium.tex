\section*{Daniel Kahnemann's Emporium}

\begin{precis}
\item Daniel Kahnemann's Emporium, Purveyor of Hermeticals, Mysticals and Curios
\item  Daniel Kahnemann runs a magic shop.  He appears to be a skinny man with a beard who speaks with a lisp.  In reality he is a demon who resembles a mind flayer.
\item  His shop is actually a portal to another dimension.  Though it appears
 unremarkable.  It will usually be "close-by" if the players want to visit it.
 It's location changes at the whim of the inscrutable Mr Kahnemann.  There's 
 also a slight and very subtle charm on the place so that players don't realize
 this.
\item  If discovered Kahnemann will claim to be defenseless and merely a trader 
 trying to go about his job.  In actuallity he delights in the suffering of 
 others and will try to sell acurs'd items to his patrons, trade them for 
 their real names so that he may control them using magic, or trade them 
 for their immortal souls.
