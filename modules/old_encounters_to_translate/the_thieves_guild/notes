 Tie in with the rake and the hedge wizard.. smuggling job gone wrong.
 The reeves men had a boat and we argued with them.. when they wanted to come aboard they
 jumped ship.
 The King of the Beggars wants them to pay for the cargo and the boat.. impounded by the Reeve.
 (Must have been tipped off).


 I've heard the ballads of your derring do.
 The real reason that the King wants to talk to them is to get more information about what's going on in the Witch Hunters Guild.

 Talks to Dimis character .. your father has passed away.  He was like a brother to me.  
 His last wish was that I forgive your debt to him.  However such an action would be construed
 as weakness so I had to carry through the charade.



 Options..
    - tie in with the bandits
    - escape the city (guards at the gate, try the smugglers route)
    - illegal mages hanging in  gibbets  "I Ernst Bloom was found to be practicing dark magic without a license").
    - caught ... trial
    - vision of the book in Itzak's study (underground encounter)
    - wraith manacles
    - introduce family of badies working with Itshak
