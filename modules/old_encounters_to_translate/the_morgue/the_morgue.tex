\section*{The Morgue}


\begin{precis}
\item Otlaf refuses to let the characters see the bodies (he's acting suspiciously).
   (bodies are going missing.. even from the mortuary .. hook to the butcher?) 
   He's relieved when he finds out what they want and why?

\item naked male body is under a sheet
\item face and chest bright red pinky colour (postmortem lividity)
(maximum lividity puts the time of death 12 hours before, similarly body has rigor mortis). 
\item body has been cut open from sternum to throat using a hatchett...
(blood magic - need to capture the essence of the person fast)
heart, lungs, intestines, stomach etc removed and not present.

\item When the players ask to see the clothes otlaf want's them to know that the clothes are 
rightfully the property of the morgue until someone claims the body.
(otlaf trying to get the body out fast to get the belt buckle).

\item Clothes have ash all over them.  Boots have mud on the back of the boots.  
Suggests that they were dragged ..
