werewolf abbey adventure here.





If you’re vain when you see me,
I might make it worse.
If I turn you to stone,
Then your gaze is a curse.

Mirror


I burrow and then reappear;
I have an eye but not an ear.
My tail grows long without an end
And everything I pass, I mend.

Needle


Four out of thirty are sharper than others
All dressed in white, flanking eight of their brothers.

Teeth



Woodland weaver
Small deceiver
Fool ensnarer
Poison bearer
Midair dancer...
What’s the answer?

Spider


I never end; I never start;
Your finger pierces through my heart.

Ring


There goes Mister Shambleshanks, alone
The undertaker of a single bone.

Dog




I’m hung by my crown; 
Fleets stop when I drown

Anchor


When someone’s solved my name, I know defeat,
Until that moment, though, I have them beat.

Riddle

My name is not the name my face displays.
That name belongs to one you cannot see.
But we are both engraved in different ways:
Yours truly, and the one who’s under me.

Gravestone


No food I cook will ever fill me
And yet one simple drink will kill me

Fire

I dance with ancient sisters three
But none of them is cold as me.
Beneath us mountains rise and fall
But we never change the dance at all.

Winter.



Poems..

Dagger or rapier,
Parry or thrust;
The blade in your hand
Is the one you can trust.


Dragons rule with greed and power
Till their time on earth is through;
Dragons never live forever
Dragons only think they do.
