      <p>
	The green skins are a race, or races, devolved from humans, warped and
	mishapen by the forces of magic.
      </p>

      <p>
	Many hundreds of years ago, Torcamunde the Accursed, a mage of
	great learning, finding himself in need of a source of armed power,
	made a pact with an unspeakable being from beyond the veil of this plane.
	Damning all those in his service, Torcamunde made the way for the creature
	to shape them as tools for destruction.  Too late, Torcamunde realized that
	he had been misled.  While his creations would be the destruction of his
	foes, they would also be the agents of his own destruction and, in most
	liklihood, the harbingers of the end of humanity.
      </p>

      <p>
	The green hordes are possesed of beastial strength, overwhelming fecundity
	and an evil rapaciousness.  Their numbers swell	rapidly and when their
	ranks reach sufficient size, their masses of poorly armed troops flow
	into civilized lands looting and destroying, overwhelming cities or breaking
	upon their walls.
      </p>

      <p>
	The get of Torcamunde is an ever present threat to the cities of the
	civilized nations.
