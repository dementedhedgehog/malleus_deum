	The most notable thing about Humans are their ubiquity and their numbers.
	Their settlements spread across the lands encroaching on that of the other
	species.

	In every inn, port, gambling den and brothel you will find
	locals who have fallen under the delusion that they are
	tough and hard, throwing their weight around, looking
	for trouble and some coin.  Thugs are your average street
	toughs, unprofessional, but cheap, muscle for hire.
