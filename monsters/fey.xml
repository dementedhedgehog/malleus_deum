      <p>
        Protectors of the forest and its denizens, Leshi are fey shape-shifters.  In their natural form they resemble large humanoids, with bark like skin, and wearing a large crown of
	branches that resemble the antlers of a giant elk.  They can transform themselves into small trees and spend long periods of time in this form.  In their tree-like form
	they closely resemble the surrounding trees and are only distinguishable by their many green eyes peering from between bartk eyelids.  With their eyes closed they are
	almost indistinguishable, except to magics that detect the Fey.   Leshi can transform into animals and are sometimes accompanied by bears or wolves.
      </p>

      <p>
	The leshi draws its power from the life force of the forest which allows it to project itself onto this plane.  They are at their most powerful at the center of their forests
	and their power diminishes as they approach its border.  They are mostly peaceful but will resort to intimidation and eventually violence if they believe there is a danger to
	their forest.  They will use mimicry and theft to deter humans from remaining in their forest to fell trees.  If that proves insufficient they will murder individuals who leave
	their camps at night.  Leshi tolerate Wood Elves and will contact them to make their wishes known to a broader group.
      </p>

      <p>
	Leshi are often solitary or live in small groups of half a dozen or more.  Often they will be found with other forest-Fey.  Like all Fey they are vulnerable to cold iron
	particularly disliking axes.
