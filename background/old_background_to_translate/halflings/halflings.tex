\section*{Halflings}


There are two major ethnic groups in the Halfling race.  The Lightfoots and the Stouts. The Tallfellows and Hairfoots live to the far south and south east respectively.  Since their numbers are comparatively small we shall ignore them for the present.\\

The Stouts hail from the rolling hill land north of Laibstadt.  They are stockier than other halfling sub-races.  It is rumoured that this is due to inbreeding between halflings and the dwarves from Carraig Caislean and Bad Dunmharaiodh.   They tend to settle away from human population centers.  Their towns lie out of the thoroughfares and are fairly well defended as they are periodically subjected to small orcish incursions and occasional pogroms from the local followers of Caiphon.  Stout settlements tend to have a lot of escape tunnels, thick doors, and arrow slits designed with a wide field of vision.  For this reason, unless a stout town lies directly in the path of an orcish horde the orcs tend to leave them alone in much the same way as a lion walks past a porcupine in favour of deer. \\

The Lightfoots live in Hibernia sufficiently far inland that dark elf incursions are seldom a problem.  Being somewhat independent of the internecine conflicts of the native Hibernians and posing no threat to any other ethnic group they exist in a fairly conflict free environment.  \\

Stouts regard Lightfoots as bon vivants and fops sheltered from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.  Lightfoots regard stouts as being not much fun whatsoever.
