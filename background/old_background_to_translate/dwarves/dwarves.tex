\section*{Dwarves}

The Dwarves are an ancient race, almost as old as the Elves.  They live in the mountains where they take refuge from the savagery of the world.  Maybe half of all Dwarves live in one of the three great Dwarven cities.  The rest live either in human cities, usually, though not always forming their own enclaves, or in small fortified settlements scattered across the western kingdoms.

Each Dwarven city is a polis, a city-state independent of other cities.  Within Dwarven cities, Dwarves vote annually for chieftains.  The chieftains vote for a king.  The king is empowered till the next election.  That said, usually the rate of political change in Dwarven society is fairly slow.  Dwarves love gold and treasures.  Their society is based on mercantilism and the various Dwarven guilds hold a lot of political power exerting that power through bribery and lobbying across the human kingdoms.

\begin{description}
\item[i) Taobh Iarann] Northernmost of the great Dwarven cities.  Famous for it's iron mines.  This city controls the northern land route from Cheruskia to Hibernia.  Taobh Iarann and Carrag Caislean are the homes of the hill dwarves.
\item[ii) Carrag Caislean] is perhaps the most outgoing of all Dwarven cities.  They annually send journey-men across the civilized kingdoms to learn new production techniques.  As such they have large expatriate populations living in most cities of Aquillonia, Hibernia, Averoigne and Aquillonia.  This has enabled them to build a large trade network in high quality goods.
\item[iii) Bad Dunmharaiodh] Home to the mountain dwarves.  It is the oldest, largest and richest of the Dwarven cities.  Bad Dunmharaiodh is surrounded by dozens of small dwarven satelitte settlments.  
\item[iv) Airgid Soir] The Easternmost Dwarven city located somewhere in the Stygian mountain ranges.  The Dwarves do not speak of it.
\item[v) Baile Óir] lies someewhere in the Karpathian mountains.  This, once great city, has fallen into darkness. The Dwarves do not speak of it.

The Dwarves are a race on the decline.  Of the five great Dwarven cities only three remain.  When Baile Óir fell the Dwarves founded the Iron League, a pan-dwarven secret agency that gathers information and uses it to aid the interests of the Dwarven nations.  


A high office in Dwarven society is the Keeper of the Book of Grudges in which all wrongs
against the Dwarven people are recorded through the ages.  Each Dwarven settlement keeps a
copy and travelling dwarves often carry XXX The Dwarven gods promise that when
the end of time comes there shall be a retribution.
