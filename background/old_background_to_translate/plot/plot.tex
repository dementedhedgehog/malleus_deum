The Dark Elves are behind everything.  Their plan is to take down Laibstadt leaving a power vacuum that they will exploit.

Steps:

   i) Poison the wells in the plaque districts.  Skaven still being paid to do so.
   ii) Exploit a loophole in the constitution that enables them to build an embassy in the city.  Promise reform.
   iii) Hibernian Princes to assassinate Siefried Nerval
   iv) Cultist uprising
   v) funding of the orcish uprising
