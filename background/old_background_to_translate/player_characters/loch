Born to an older diplomat father, Ederan grew up in a mundane life but with a sense of wonder. He took a job at as a researcher at a university, a respectable job, and moved into the arcana section where he read solidly of magic. He dabbled in secret and would always sneak off to see the litany  of captured monsters and enemies the army would occasionally parade through the city (ala the Roman practise..can't remember what it was called right now)

when his Father died and Ederan was putting his affairs in order, he found an old journal bound in dragon skin full of tales of his Father's previous life as an adventurer (wizard, cleric, fighter..whatever) and an old dragon's claw. Ederan decided he had lived a lie for too long and took up serious magical study, making the claw his arcane focus.

That should do for now? Stuff about being an elf in such a racist society has given him a strong sense of justice for the oppressed and hatred of bigotry.
