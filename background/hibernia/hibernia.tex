\section*{Hibernia}

Hibernia is the westernmost region of the civilized world.  It is loosely composed of five kingdoms and seven different races. Historically, Hibernia has been ruled over by the King of Prydain.  Prydains power fell with that of Aquillonia and the King of Prydain's title as Over-King is now largely symbolic.  Brythinia rules Hibernia as the King of Prydain is now a sworn vassal of the Emperor.  Without the military support of Brythinia the King of Prydain has very little power of his own.  The kingdoms of Hibernia have a long and brutal history of bloodshed.  It may be fair to say that the stability of the nation is derived from the fact that they dislike being ruled by Brythinia far less than they hate their neighbours.

In addition to the five kingdoms there are small settlements of Halflings and Dwarves scattered throughout the region.  These settlements tend to be neutral, staying out of internecine conflict whenever they can.  The largest such Dwarvish settlement is Iarann ​​Portach, located near the marshes north of Gereberg.   


\begin{itemize}
\item Rowan: King of Laighin,
\item Leith: King of the Albanachs (Pict-hibernica),
\item Strager: King of Galliand, 
\item Morn: King of Prydain,
\item Dral: King of Aesirlund,
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Laighan, House Rowan}
\origin Laighin, Eastern Hibernia\\
\sigil Rowan Tree\\
\capital World's End\\
\words Semper vigilans\\
\wordsii Always vigilant\\
\inc{rowan.png}

To the west of Hibernia lies Laighin, land of the self-styled true-hibernians.   The people of coastal Hibernia, Laighan and Albanachlund and Prydain, are perpetually being raided by dark elf slavers and buccaneers.  Nagaroth casts a shadow over these kingdoms.  This has created a greater degree of co-operation and less combative approach to solving internal struggles as civil war would invite the attention of the genicidal dark elves.  

The king, Ceallagh Rowan II, has fought to build the modernize the economy of Laighin.  Investing in a large standing navy, roads and legal reform.  Worlds's End, the capital, is now the second largest city in Hibernia.  World's End is a large port, it is the home of great Herring fleets that fish off the coasts.  There is a large timber industry and also boat building yards.  There are also local copper mines.   Recently there have been border clashes with the land locked Aesirlunders who have taken to raiding their neighbours.

\subsection{Albanachlund, House Leith}
\origin Albanachlund, Pict-Hibernica, Northern Hibernia\\
\sigil Boar's Head\\
\capital Heatherhal\\
\words Vulneratis non victus\\
\wordsii Victory or death\\
\inc{leith.png}

In the north the fierce Albanachs fight constantly against the dark elves, with one another, and with the Aesirlunders.  The Albernachs (sometimes call pict-hibernians by Brythinians) and Laighans are largely Hibernian. 

Naomhán Leith is King of Albanachlund.  His family has been ruling the kingdom for hundreds of years.  The Leith family is large.  They are widely hated by the populace, with a repuatation for brutality and underhandedness.  There have been a number of uprisings all of which have subsequentyly been quelled.  After the sacking of Heatherhall by the Druchii, the Albanachs constructed a large naval fleet.  They have been fighting battles at sea with mixed results against the Dark Elves ever since.

The crown of Albanachlund is claimed by Gerolt Draal, King of Aesirlund, through a hereditary claim that is too complicated to discuss in this document.  There is ongoing conflict between the Alabanachs and the Aesirlunders.

\subsection{Galliand, House Strager}
\origin Galliand, South Western Hibernia\\
\sigil Anchor\\
\capital Neuport\\
\words Tenete: Hold fast\\
\inc{strager.png}

In the far south east of Hibernia lies Galliand.  A large proportion of the population of Galliand are of Averoignian descent, though there is a very sizable minority of Hibernians living in the region as well.  Gallianders largely support Brythinia fearing an uprising by the Hibernian population.  Being so close to Laibstadt the kingdom has adopted many Brythinian customs and sayings.  Many6 speak Brythinian or Averoignian.  Gallianders and Prydains are generally clean shaven unlike the inhabitants of the other parts of Hibernia.

Conant Strager is the King of Galliand.  He has the reputation for being lazy and enjoying the high life.  He seems to be a reasonable diplomat however as his country has prospered through good planning (pr possibly good fortune) under his rule.


\subsection{Prydain, House Morn}
\origin Prydain, Southern Hibernia\\
\sigil Eagle's Head\\
\capital Cathal\\
\words Ibi ius, per deos\\
\wordsii Our Right by the gods\\
\inc{morn.png}

In the south of Hibernia lies Prydain fading remnant of the Aquilonnian occupation.  A nation composed of Hibernians, Hiberno-Aquilonians and Brythinians.  
The influence of Aquilonia is still notable in the Architecture of Cathal, the kingdoms capital.  

Henri Morn is the King of Prydain and High King of Brythinia, of middling years and seeming intelligence, he acts as a puppet for the Emperor.  In recent years he has made a number of requests to Gerolt Draal to cease his attacks on his neighbours.  These have been ignored, publically highlighting his powerlessness within Hibernia.


\subsection{Aesirlund, House Draal}
\origin Aesirlund, Western Hibernia\\
\sigil Hydra\\
\capital Gerebug\\
\words Invicta: Indomitable\\
\inc{draal.png}

To the east of Hibernia lies the kingdom of Aesirlund, the southernmost and westernmost of Cheruskian settlements.  In recent years Aesirlunders have been aggressively raiding bordering townships causing a great deal of tension within Hibernia.  The Cheruskians hold the Hibernians to be beneath them.  Gerolt Draal, King of Aesirlund, is a young and ambitious man, who has made some extremely bellicose statements over recent years.   He was publicly censured by the Emperor over his behaviour a number of years ago.  But the pause in his warlike behaviour has been short-lived.
