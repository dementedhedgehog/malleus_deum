\section{The Noble Houses \\ of Brythynia}

There is a schism among the ruling houses of this, the greatest of the empires of man.  
The noble houses may, superficially, be split into two factions the Royalists and the 
Reformers.  These factions have been engaged in an ongoing political struggle for power
for centuries. \\

The Royalists:
\begin{itemize}
  \item House Nerval: The ruling house of the empire.  They have a strong mercantile base and are fairly popular with the people.
  \item House Lastell: Puritans from the south.
  \item House Vizeare: an old house from the west, rumoured to be involved in terrible depravities.
  \item House Thau: Horse lords from the far west.  Regarded by many as uncivilized. They spend all their time hunting Orcs.  
  \item House Fulcade: Coastal traders from the south east.
  \item House Masselan: Rule a Cheruskian barbarian nation, vassal to Brythynia.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}
The Reformists:
\begin{itemize}
  \item House Castellan: The house formerly in charge of the defense of Laibstadt.
  \item House Avenel: Rulers of Averoigne.  They have absorbed much of their civilization from the Aquillonians and feel culturally superior to other nations in the empire.
  \item House Gehrig: Former ruling house.  Only a few remnants members of the family remain.
  \item The Hibernian Princes: Five satellite kingdoms that hate Brythynia only slightly less than they hate each other.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Rowan: King of Laighin,
      \item Leith: King of Pict-hibernica,
      \item Strager: King of Galliand, 
      \item Morn: King of Prydain,
      \item Dral: King of Aesirlund,
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The Nerval family are the current ruling family of Brythynia, its satellite kingdoms 
Averoigne, Hibernia, Thule, Southern Cheruskia and lesser tributaries.  Originally a merchant 
family they orchestrated the uprising against Frederick Gehrig I during the War of the 
Silver Flame.  Once the war was over and all known cultists had been executed or had fled they
managed to retain control of the empire despite their humble backgrounds.

\words Nullo adversante: Unopposed\\
\inc{masselan.png}

House Masselan hails from southern Cheruskia.  Cheruskians are a race of extremely warlike, blonde or red-headed barbarians that speak their own language.  It is said by the Cheruskians, that there are only three worthy ways to die: fighting the dark elves (which they call Svartálfar), fighting the orcs, or fighting the cold (having killed all the orcs and svartálfin).  The terrain is rugged.  Their population is not large.  There is little farm land in the north and where it be, is as poor as the nights are long.  They have voluntarily joined the Brythynian empire in exchange for an annual stipend to aid in fighting their enemies (iron, gold, silver timber, and salt) and gained far more independence than most of the other subjugate kingdoms by doing so.  The Masselans seem to be astute political players but as yet lack any real power base.\\

Notable people:
\begin{description}
\item[Gunnar Masselan, Jarl of Suid-Cheruskia]
\item[Jørg Masselan, Prince of Suid-Cheruskia]  Gunnar's eldest son.

\section*{Hibernia}

Hibernia is composed of five different kingdoms and seven different races.  To the south, in Galliand, large proportions of the population are of Averoignian descent.  To the West you have the, self-styled, true-hibernians of Laighin.  There are small population centers of Halflings and Dwarves scattered throughout the region.  In the north the fierce pict-hibernics fight constantly against the dark elves.  To the south lies Prydain fading remnant of the Aquilonnian occupation.  While to the east lies the small kingdom of Aesirlund, the southernmost and westernnmost of Cheruskian settlements.  The only thing these peoples have in common is that they all hate Brythynia slightly less than they hate each other.\\

The people of coastal Hibernia are perpetually being raided by dark elf slavers and buccaneers. Nagaroth casts a shadow over the land.
