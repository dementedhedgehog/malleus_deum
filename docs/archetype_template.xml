      <sectiontitle>Character Creation</sectiontitle>      
      <p>
    Follow these steps to create a {{ archetype.get_title() }} character
    <label>sec:character-creation</label>
      </p>

      <olist>
    <li>
      <p>
            Print out the character sheet.  
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>
            Choose a name for the character and write it on the character sheet..
      </p>            
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
            Write your own name in the players name area on the character sheet.
      </p>            
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
            Fill in the Archetype name: {{ archetype.get_title() }} 
      </p>            
    </li>

    <li>
      Fill in your Height: {{ archetype.height }}, Weight: {{ archetype.weight }}, and Age: 
      {{ archetype.age }}. {{ archetype.gender }}
    </li>

    <li>
      Fill in your level: 1.
    </li>
        
    <li>
      Fill in your characters tags: {{ archetype.get_tags_str() }}
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>
        Choosing one of the following sets of Primary Ability Ranks:
        {{ archetype.get_primary_abilities() }}
        Then for each ability roll an <emph>unmodified</emph> Std-Check against a DC of 13.
        Add one to the ability rank for that ability if the check is successful.  Add an
        additional one if a boon is rolled.  Subtract one from the rank if a bane is rolled.
      </p>      
      <p>
        For example, if you get a result of +2 in Strength you should write down Strength +2 in the
        primary abilities section of the character sheet.
      </p>      
    </li>

    <li>
      Work out some details about your characters background and starting skills using the tables
      from the <emph>Level 1 Progression</emph> Section below.  Do this now as it may effect your abilities
      later in the character creation process.
    </li>    

    <li>
      Record your <bold>Archetype Move Distance</bold>: {{ archetype.get_move_distance() }} and add your
      Speed Modifier to get your Move and Move Modifier.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Record your characters Health and Stamina:   
      <descriptions>
        <term>Stamina = </term>
        <description>
          {% set level_one = archetype.get_level(1) %}
          {{ level_one.stamina }} + Endurance Modifier 
        </description>

        <term>Health = </term>
        <description>
          {{ level_one.health }} + Strength Modifier 
        </description>

        <term>Health Refresh Rate = </term>
        <description>
          {{ level_one.health_refresh }}
        </description>
      </descriptions>
      Your current stamina and health are the same as your full stamina and health.  The temporary
      values are zero.  Write the health refresh rate as is in the refresh rate
      box on the character sheet.
    </li>

    <li>
      Record your characters dice pool: maximum and refresh values.  The current values are
      initially set to the maximum values:
      <descriptions>
        
        <term>Magic Pool Maximum/Refresh = </term>
        <description>
        {{ level_one.magic -}}d6/+{{- level_one.magic_refresh }}d6
        </description>

        <term>Mettle Pool Maximum/Refresh = </term>
        <description>
          {{level_one.mettle -}}d6/+{{- level_one.mettle_refresh }}d6
        </description>

        <term>Luck Pool Maximum/Refresh = </term>
        <description>{{ level_one.luck -}}d6/+{{- level_one.luck_refresh }}d6
        </description>
      </descriptions>

      <bold>N.B.</bold> Dice pool stats are recorded as number of d6s.  So if you have
      3d6 in a pool you write <emph>``3d6''</emph> on your character sheet.      Similarly
      for your refresh values if it says +1d6 for a refresh value, write <emph>``+1d6''</emph>
      on your character sheet.  You don't roll any dice here!
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
            Players should choose a few initial aspects for their character. It is best
        to choose your aspects in a group with the other players and GM. Newly acquired 
        aspects have a difficulty of 9 + d6 unless the archetype description or the GM
        says otherwise.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Some suggested aspects for this archetype are: {{ archetype.aspect_examples -}}.
      </p>        
      <p>
        But feel free to choose an aspect of your own.  Try to create one that will
        generate interesting game play.
      </p>        
    </li>

    <li>
      Optionally sketch out a couple of lines of back story with your fellow players and 
      GM with a few points about the characters history.  For example, Dourli might come
      from the Iron Mountains and be searching for his long lost cousin Grimli.
    </li>

    <li>
      Determine your starting money: {{ archetype.starting_cash }}.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>
        You get some starting equipment for free: {{ archetype.starting_gear }}
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Buy equipment. Now you can purchase any common equipment from the equipment list.
      </p>      
    </li>
      </olist>

      <p>You are now finished character creation.</p>
