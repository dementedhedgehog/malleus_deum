      Malleus Deum is set in a slightly Grim Dark European divergent plane.
      It is set in a Europe closer to the Renaissance than the middle ages.
      It is supposed to have a feel somewhere between Call of Cthulhu and
      Dungeons and Dragons.

    <p noindent="true">
      If your campaign is set in a medieval European style setting
      then the following information may be of interest:
    </p>

    <list>
      <li>
	There was no inflation.  You could bury money and it would still
	be worth the same amount a hundred years later.
      </li>
      
      <li>
	People were far from starving and spent a quarter of their
	money on beer!  Average folk had disposable income, but
	would not be able to save enough to go up a social class.
	Housing was expensive, especially houses where one lived
	and worked.      
      </li>
      
      <li>
	Income inequality was extreme.
      </li>

      <li>
	Banks existed and were very powerful organizations.  They provided financing
	(loans) and unwriting (insurance), accepted deposits,  changed money, and
	provided bills of exchange (cheques).
