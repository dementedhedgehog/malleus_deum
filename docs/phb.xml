        Malleus~Deum is a fantasy pen and paper, tabletop, role-playing game (TTRPG),
        In Malleus Deum one player assumes the role of Game Master or <defn>GM</defn>
        and plays the part of a narrator in a game of collaborative story-telling.  Other 
        players adopt the role of individuals within the story, called
        Player Characters, each of which is described by a Character Sheet.

	All the other characters, monsters and events within the story
        are controlled by the GM and are referred to as Non-Player Characters or 
        <defn>NPCs</defn>.  We  use the term  
        <defn>Character</defn> to denote both player characters and non-player
        characters.
      </p>

      <p>
	The details of how this all fits together, how to create a
	character, how to make checks, and more is covered in the next few chapters.

      <sectiontitle>Character Overview</sectiontitle>
      <p>
        <indexentry>Character</indexentry>
	Each player has a Player Character, which is an avatar they control within
	the game.  Each Player Character has a list of statistics that describe what that character
	can do and how well they can do it.  Player Characters are described by:
        <list>
          <li>An <bold>Archetype</bold> and a <bold>Level</bold>.  The Archetype describes the
	  characters race their profession, and the set of abilities available to them.  The Level
	  describes how advanced, powerful, and comptent the character is.</li>
          <li>Two Hit Point statistics: <bold>Stamina</bold> and <bold>Health</bold>.</li>
          <li>Three Dice Pool statistics: Magic, Mettle, and Luck.</li>
          <li>A set of five Primary Abilities: Strength, Endurance, Agility, Speed,
          and Perception.</li>
          <li>Four or more <bold>Defensive Abilities</bold>: Armour, Dodge, Block and Parry.</li>
          <li>A set of <bold>Common Abilities</bold> shared by all Player Characters,</li>
          <li>A range of other specialized Abilities, drawn from four groups General, Lore, Martial and
	  Magic, <eg/> Sword Strike, Arcane Lore, Pick Locks, and <ellipsis/></li>
          <li>A set of Aspects, which are a special type of ability that describes some facet of the
  	  characters personality, relationships, or philosophy e.g:
  	  Silent Outcast, Naive Appeaser, Dipsomaniac, Declared vengeance
  	  against Elogh King of the Goblins.  Aspects are tied to game mechanics and have
	  real consequences in the game, </li>
          <li>Optionally, a description of the character, a back-story for the character,
          and any tertiary statistics the player might want to include:
          Height, Weight, Age, Hair Colour and so on.</li>
        </list>
      </p>
      
      <p>
	In order for a player to <bold>create a Player Character, first choose an archetype,
	then follow the detailed steps for character creation in the archetype documentation.</bold>.
      </p>

  	  We shall illustrate game mechanics in this book using three PCs: Dourli, intrepid
	  dwarven warrior; Rozlyn, shadowy cutpurse; and Mophissius, sometime dabbler in the

      <sectiontitle>Archetype</sectiontitle>
      <p>
        <indexentry>Archetype</indexentry>
        Each character has an archetype.  An <defn>Archetype</defn> is a combination of a
        race and a class, for example a character might choose to be a Red Mage
        or a Halfling Rover.  Archetypes define which abilities a character may have
  	or learn and how hard it is for them to acquire that ability.
      </p>
      
      <design>
        Archetypes are indivisible because it makes them more modular and allows us to
	balance one archetype without effecting existing archetypes.
      </design>
    </section>

    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Level</sectiontitle>
      <p>
        <indexentry>Level</indexentry>
        A characters level represents the characters competence and experience.
        The character's level usually starts at one and increases when the GM decides that
  	it is appropriate.  As a rule of thumb characters should gain levels at the end
	of a story arc or when the players have accomplished something noteworthy in the game.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Primary Abilities</sectiontitle>
      <p>
        All characters share a set of <defn>Primary Abilities</defn> that describe the
	characters physical capabilities.  These provide a bonus to certain checks and may
	be prerequisites for other abilities.   In Malleus Deum primary attributes are
	treated like all other abilities, see Section<ref>sec:primary_abilities</ref>
	on page<pageref>sec:primary_abilities</pageref>.

      <sectiontitle>Defensive Abilities</sectiontitle>
      <indexentry>Defence Check</indexentry>
      <p>
        Defensive abilities represent how difficult a character is to hit.  When an NPC tries to
  	hit a PC in combat the player makes a defensive ability check against the difficulty
  	of the attack.  There are a number of defensive abilities but the four most common are
	Armour on page<pageref>ability:armour</pageref>,
	Dodge on page<pageref>ability:dodge</pageref>, or Block on
	page<pageref>ability:block</pageref>.  Some weapon classes allow the user to parry
	blows with those weapons, <eg/> see Staff Parry on page<pageref>ability:staff.parry</pageref>,
	and Sword Parry on page<pageref>ability:sword.parry</pageref>.  	
	We use the term <defn>Defence Check</defn> <indexentry>Defensive Checks</indexentry>
        to refer to these ability checks irrespective of what underlying defensive ability the
	player choose to make the check.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Dice Pool Statistics</sectiontitle>
      <p>
  	Characters have three dice pool statistics: Mettle, Magic and Luck.
	Dice pools consist of a number of six sided dice.  
	We describe how to use dice pools to make checks in Section<ref>sec:dice-pool</ref> on
        page<pageref>sec:dice-pool</pageref>.
      </p>

          <p>
            Casting magic uses a dice pool and many special rules described in
            Section<ref>ch:magic</ref> on page<pageref>ch:magic</pageref>.
          </p>

  	  <p>
  	    Not all characters are able to cast spells, but all characters have a magic pool.
  	    This pool represents their animus, their spark of life, and can be use to resist
  	    spells.
  	  </p>
        </description>
	
        <term>Mettle</term>
        <description>
          <indexentry>Pools<subentry>see Mettle</subentry></indexentry>
          This dice pool measures the characters current confidence in their
	  situation, their willpower and morale.

            <indexentry>Luck Pool</indexentry>
            Characters have a Luck Pool that represents the players
  	    manifest destiny, their luck.

    </section>


    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Hit Points</sectiontitle>
      <p>
        A characters physical well-being is represented by two sets of
        statistics: Stamina and Health, collectively called their <defn>Hit Points</defn>.
      </p>
      
      <descriptions>
        <term>Stamina</term>
        <description>
          <indexentry>Stamina<subentry>see Hit Points</subentry></indexentry>
          <p>
            <indexentry>Stamina</indexentry>
            is the characters freshness, their energy, their vigour, and their ability to
	    shrug off minor wounds, bruising, scratches, glancing blows,
	    near misses and the like.  Damage to stamina leaves the character breathless,
	    a little stunned, bruised and battered but not physically too badly hurt.
	    As the character's Stamina decreases their ability to avoid serious damage
	    from attackers decreases and the danger of getting really physically hurt
	    increases.  Stamina is recovered quickly.
          </p>
        </description>

        <term>Health</term>
        <description>
          <indexentry>Healing<subentry>Health</subentry></indexentry>
          <p>
            represents the characters brawn, their physical capacity to take damage.
	    Damage to health takes the form of lacerations, deep bruising, sprained joints.
	    Wounds that take time to heal, so it takes time to restore health. The character
	    gains Health back slowly, at their Rest Rate when they Sleep.
          </p>
        </description>
      </descriptions>

      <p>
        <indexentry>Health</indexentry>
        <indexentry>Zero Health</indexentry>
        Characters can take damage to either of these stats as the result of an in-game event.
	For example, when a character takes damage during combat they will usually take it from
	their Stamina first and	then their Health. Other damage, such as falling damage, applies
	directly to Health irrespective of the current Stamina.
      </p>

      <playexample>
        <p>
          Dourli, our amiable dwarven friend has somehow managed to find himself
          in a brawl with some of the towns thugs.  Dourli is stabbed by one of the thugs 
          for 4 damage.  He only has 3 Stamina remaining so his Stamina
          is reduced to 0, his Health is reduced by 1, he gains the Bloodied tag, and has to
	  make a Mettle Check. He fails his Mettle Check and gains the Checked Condition.
        </p>
      </playexample>

      <figure>
        <img id="mj_gothic_city" scale="0.123"/>
      </figure>
      
      <p>
	Both Stamina and Health have a minimum value of zero, they cannot be
	negative numbers.  A character with zero Stamina gains the <defn>Bloodied</defn> condition.
	A character with zero Health is <defn>Near-Death</defn>, see page<pageref>sec:conditions</pageref>
	for more information on conditions.  Characters who are down are effectively
  	too hurt and too weak to defend themselves or do too much and are in danger of dying,
  	see Section<ref>sec:death</ref> on page<pageref>sec:death</pageref> of the GMG.	See
  	Section<ref>sec:healing</ref> on page<pageref>sec:healing</pageref> for information
  	on Healing.

    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Common Abilities</sectiontitle>
      <indexentry>Common Abilities</indexentry>
      <p>
	Common abilities are a set of abilties that are shared by all characters.  These
	include abilities like Lore, Brawl and Swim.
      </p>      
    </section>

    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Other Abilities</sectiontitle>
      <indexentry>Other Abilities</indexentry>
      <p>
        <indexentry>Abilities</indexentry>
        In addition to the primary, defensive and common abilities, each character has a range of 
	<defn>Other Abilities</defn> which represent more unusual or esoteric skills that they might have.
      </p>

      <p>
        A character's initial abilities are determined by their archetype.  The characters
  	archetype assigns a number of abilities for the player to choose from.  Abilities are
  	described further in Chapter<ref>ch:abilities</ref> on page<pageref>ch:abilities</pageref>.
      </p>


      <p>
	<indexentry>Ability Rank</indexentry>
	<indexentry>Rank - Ability</indexentry>
	Abilities have ranks and the higher the ability rank the easier it is for the character
	to succeed at those ability checks.  Ability ranks are written after
	the ability.  So, for example, we might say that Dourli has Axe Cleave 3, which means
	that he has Axe Cleave at rank 3.  
      </p>

      <!-- <p> -->
      <!-- 	<indexentry>Ability[Templates]</indexentry> -->
      <!-- 	<indexentry>Template - Ability</indexentry> -->
      <!-- 	Some abilities may be templated.  In this case the template will follow the ability name -->
      <!-- 	and be written in square brackets, <eg/> History[Westreich] 2.  The template indicates that -->
      <!-- 	the knowledge is narrower than the ability name alone suggests.  The GM can choose whatever -->
      <!-- 	template values they like for templated abilities. -->
      <!-- </p> -->

      <p>
	<indexentry>Ability Specialization</indexentry>
	Some abilities have specializations.  In this case the specialization will follow the ability name
	and be written in square brackets, <eg/> History[Westreich] 2.  The template indicates that
	the knowledge is narrower than the ability name alone suggests.  The GM can choose whatever
	template values they like for templated abilities.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Aspects</sectiontitle>
      <p>
        Aspects are descriptions about a characters personality, their philosophy or
	their relationships.  Aspects tie those descriptions to game mechanics and allow checks
        to be made against them.  Mechanically, Aspects are just another type of Ability, and are
	defined in detail in Chapter<ref>ch:aspects</ref> on page<pageref>ch:aspects</pageref>.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Background</sectiontitle>
      <p>
        Players may create a background or back-story for their character.  At least
        some of the players background should be fleshed out at character creation time.  The
        background helps to tie characters to one another and to give them a purpose and a
        feeling for how they fit in the world.  This is best done collaboratively with the
	GM and possibly	with the other players as well.

    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Tags</sectiontitle>
      <p>
	<indexentry>Tag</indexentry> 
	A <emph>Tag</emph> is a label or signifier attached to something in the world.
	A cellar might be <emph>dark</emph> and <emph>musty</emph>, or a monsters attack
	might be <emph>undead</emph> <indexentry>Damage Type</indexentry>.
	If the GM describes a cellar as being dark then we say it is tagged dark, a dwarven 
	character is tagged dwarf.  Tags form a bridge between the narrative game and the
	game rules.
      </p>

      <p>
	Various rules apply only when certain tags are in play.  Other events apply new tags
	to characters, objects and scenarios in the game.  Characters may use tags to gain
	an advantage in a check.  Tags may also be prerequisites or using abilities, describe
	weapon damage types, properties that effect magic use,
	monster classes <etc/>
      </p>

      <figure>
	<img id="mj_crow" scale="0.23"/>
      </figure>      

      <playexample>
	<p>
          Dourli hides from a local gang of thugs in a cellar.  The GM describes the 
          cellar as dark and dank and storing old barrels.  The thugs enter the cellar 
          and look around.   Dourli invokes the dark tag of the cellar saying ``They'll 
          have trouble seeing me in the dark''.  The GM agrees and reduces the difficulty
	  of Dourli's Stealth check.
	</p>
      </playexample>
    </section>    


    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Common Conditions, Tags and Effects<label>sec:conditions</label></sectiontitle>
      <p>
	<indexentry>Condition</indexentry> 
	A <defn>Condition</defn> is a tag with explicit in-game rules attached to it.
	All conditions are tags, but not all tags are conditions.  Conditions represent
	temporary modifications to the characters abilities, <eg/> Slowed, or Bloodied.
      </p>

      <p>
	<indexentry>Condition<subentry>Save Ends</subentry></indexentry> 
	<indexentry>Save Ends</indexentry>
	Conditions typically last for the length of a combat or until a <bold>Save Ends</bold>
	the effects of the condition.   How and when a PC can save to end a condition should be
	specified on a per condition, or per instance basis.  For example text might say:
	If the character has a fishing net dropped on them they are Prone Agility ends with a
	DC of 12.  Saves are made at the end of the characters turn and, if they have multiple
	saves to make, in any order the character wishes.
      </p>

      <p>
	The following is a list of some frequently used conditions.
      </p>      

      <descriptions>
	<term>Alert</term>
	<description>
          <indexentry>Alert Condition</indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Conditions<subentry>Alert</subentry></indexentry>
	  <label>condition:alert</label>
	  The character is alert for danger.  They are less likely to be surprised.
	  They gain +2 to Awareness checks.  It is difficult to stay alert for long periods
	  of time. PCs cannot claim to be alert for hours on end.  Something has to happen to
	  alert them.  For example, guards are typically not alert, infiltrators typically are alert.
	  If a group makes a lot of noise, <eg/> due to combat, then other groups nearby will
	  become alert.
	</description>

	<term>Aware</term>
	<description>
	  <label>defn:aware</label>
          <indexentry>Aware Condition</indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Conditions<subentry>Aware</subentry></indexentry>
	  A character or group is Aware if they believe that they could come into confrontation imminently.


	  One character or group is Aware of another if they make a successful Perception or Listen check
	  against their opponents Stealth. or if the GM determines they are Aware.  If this check fails
	  then the character or group are Unaware.
	  <emph>Typically groups will be aware of one another unless one side has approached the other
	  stealthily, or unless one side is laying in ambush.  For groups the GM should use a Delegated
	  Group Check</emph>.  The awareness check can be modified if individuals have the Alert Condition
	  see page<pageref>condition:alert</pageref>
	</description>        
	
	<term>Blind</term>
	<description>
          <indexentry>Blind Condition</indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Conditions<subentry>Blind</subentry></indexentry>
          The character cannot see.  Ambush, Surprise, Initiative, Attack Roles,
	  Dodge, Parry and Block receive a -6 modifier against all opponents.
	</description>

	<term>Bloodied</term>
	<description>
          <indexentry>Bloodied Condition</indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Conditions<subentry>Bloodied</subentry></indexentry>       
          The character has suffered damage to their Health.  When a character first
	  suffers health damage in a fight they must make a Mettle Check.
	</description>    
	
	<term>Broken</term>
	<description>
          <label>condition:broken</label>
          <indexentry>Broken Condition</indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Conditions<subentry>Broken</subentry></indexentry>       
          The character has lost the will to fight and must withdraw from battle.
          On their turn they may attack but may not move into melee combat unless
	  they have no other choice.  This condition occurs after a character
	  has failed two Mettle Checks in combat.
	</description>

	<term>Burning</term>
	<description>
          <indexentry>Burning Condition</indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Conditions<subentry>Burning</subentry></indexentry>
	  The character is on fire.  They must attempt to put out the fire or make
	  a Mettle Check each round to resist doing so.
	</description>
	
	<term>Checked</term>
	<description>
          <label>condition:checked</label>
          <indexentry>Checked Condition</indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Conditions<subentry>Checked</subentry></indexentry>       
          The character has lost momentum in a fight. The character must make a
	  Mettle Check to charge or pursue.  This condition occurs after the
	  character has failed a single Mettle Check in combat.
	</description>
	
	<term>Dazed</term>
	<description>
          <indexentry>Dazed Condition</indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Conditions<subentry>Dazed</subentry></indexentry>	  
	  The character receives a -2 modifer to all Checks.
	  This often occurs when the character has suffered a nasty injury and are
	  suffering a great deal of pain.  Condition lasts for 3 rounds or until a
	  Mettle Check is made.
	</description>

	<term>Distracted</term>
	<description>
          <indexentry>Distracted Condition</indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Conditions<subentry>Distracted</subentry></indexentry>       
          Something has caught the characters attention and they are not paying
          attention to their surrounds.  They make Ambush, Surprise, Missile Attacks, and 
          Perception Checks at -2.

	    <indexentry>Ability<subentry>Gaining</subentry></indexentry><indexentry>Gaining an Ability</indexentry>
	    <p>
	      The character may gain a completely new ability.  The character must be able to learn
	      the ability, and the character must have already gained any prerequisite abilities.
	      Abilities are divided using tags into a number of categorizes. For example, the Axe Strike
	      ability is tagged Weapon, Heavy, Martial, Axe.  This means that if the character gains a
	      martial ability when they go up a level they may take the Axe Strike 1 ability or any of the
  	      other ability tagged with the <emph>martial</emph> of the given rank, e.g. Sword Strike 1.
	      If the character gains an Axe ability they may only choose from the abilities tagged with
	      <emph>axe</emph>.  In order to take an ability the abilities prerequisites must be met.

	<subsectiontitle>How often can you Check?</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
          <indexentry>Abilities<subentry>Check Once</subentry></indexentry>
          In the usual course of play each character can perform a check once - twice if a
  	  reroll is used.  For example,  Dourli might try opening a box quickly by picking
  	  locks.  If Dourli fails he might check to open the box with his axe but he can't
  	  try picking the lock again.  The GM may consider that Dourli has used all the time
  	  available in his attempt to pick the lock and so no other characters may attempt
  	  to do so, or that there is further time available and someone else can try and
  	  pick the lock.
	</p>

	<p>
  	  The GM should use their commonsense to determine what constitutes a new check,
  	  an attempt to quickly open a lock is one check.  However Dourli may be able to
  	  make multiple checks to see if he can shoot a lever on the other side of a room
  	  as each shot is it's own new and unique check.

          <indexentry>Abilities<subentry>Taking Time</subentry></indexentry>
          <indexentry>Taking Time</indexentry>
  	  Many tasks can be automatically completed given enough time.  For example,
  	  for a mundane lock the GM might rule that Dourli automatically unlocks the box
  	  if he spends a few hours tinkering with it.  This process is called
  	  <defn>Taking Time</defn>.

  	    Sometimes everyone in a group has to make a check.  For example, if the party is
  	    attacked using poisonous gas everyone in the party has to save.  When
  	    <defn>Everyone Checks</defn>, each group member makes a separate check
  	    independent of the rest of the group and each individual suffers any

  	    In a delegate check a player character is <bold>delegated</bold> by the GM
  	    to make a check on behalf of the whole group.  If that check fails the party
  	    fails the check. The GM may choose the delegate at random or at their own
  	    discretion. Some examples of Delegate Checks are Initiative, Stealth,
  	    Perception, Ambush and Surprise rolls.  But more on these later.

          <indexentry>Rerolls</indexentry>
  	  The most important rule for rerolls is that <emph>no check can be rerolled more than
  	  once</emph> for any reason.  Secondly, a reroll is just that.  The Character cannot choose
  	  to perform a different action when rerolling, they are already committed to performing the original
  	  action, they are just able to reroll the check. If the player rerolls the check they
  	  must take the result from the second roll. When making a reroll the player must reroll
  	  the same number of dice they used in the original check - they cannot choose to add or
  	  remove dice from the check for dice pool checks.  All checks may be rerolled unless the
	  ability states otherwise.
	</p>

	<p>
	  When a dice pool check is rerolled, exhausted dice are lost from the reroll
  	  but not from the original roll.

      <!--   characters can successfully perform certain actions within the game.  Checks are -->

      <p>
        <indexentry>Check</indexentry>
        In this chapter we describe <emph>Checks</emph>, the core mechanic
  	of the game. Checks are used to determine whether a character can
	perform any non-trivial and narratively interesting actions, like
	climbing a wall, closing a protective circle, blocking an attack
	against them, casting a spell, or jumping a horse over a fence.  

	In order for a players character to perform challenging actions the player
	must make an <defn>Check</defn> which involves rolling some dice,
	possibly adding a modifier and determining whether the total of the roll
	and modifier is greater than or equal to some difficulty, if so the check
	succeeds, otherwise it fails.
      </p>

      <p>
        <indexentry>Check<subentry>Difficulty</subentry></indexentry>
        <indexentry>Check<subentry>DC</subentry></indexentry>
        There are two main varieties of check: <emph>Standard 2d12 Checks</emph>, and
  	<emph>d6 Dice Pool Checks</emph>.  These two checks use a different set of dice
	and have different rules.
      </p>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>When to Check?</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
          As a GM when should you require that your players make a check?  Make sure that
          you only require players to check when: <emph>the outcome is uncertain and failure
          makes the game more interesting</emph>.  Many tasks are easy enough that they
  	  can be completed automatically.  In this case no check is required to perform the
  	  action. Harder variants of the task might require a check though.  For example,
  	  opening a door might be considered an easy task that automatically succeeds,
  	  while opening a door quietly might require a check.  Similarly breaking down a
  	  door might require a check to perform quickly but can be done automatically given
  	  enough time and given that one of the characters has an axe.

      <indexentry>Standard Check</indexentry>
      <indexentry>Check<subentry>Standard</subentry></indexentry>
      Standard Checks are the simplest and most common check.
      In order to make a <defn>Standard Check (Std Check)</defn> the player
      rolls 2d12, adds any relevant bonus for proficiency in the skill being used to the
      result.  The check succeeds if the total dice result rolled is greater than or equal
      to the task's difficulty.  The GM determines the <defn>Difficulty (DC)</defn> and any
      modifiers.  The modifiers may be different for different characters.	
      <equation>
        <line>Std Check:</line>
        <line>2d12 + Bonus <geqqsymbol/> DC - Modifiers</line>
      </equation>

      <indexentry>Check<subentry>Modifiers</subentry></indexentry>
      <indexentry>Check<subentry>Bonus</subentry></indexentry>
      The value on the left in the equation above is calculated by the player making the check,
      the value on the right is calculated by the GM.  Note that <emph>the modifier is subtracted from
      the DC</emph>. That means that modifiers for the players that are good are always positive, modifiers
      that are bad for the players are negative.  The Bonus depends on the check being made.  For ability,
      the most common kind of check, the Bonus is the Rank of the Ability.

      The DC for the check is determined by GM fiat, based on their interpretation of the difficulty
      of the task, the current environment and any other factors that might apply.  Some abilities
      have a <defn>Default Difficulty</defn>, or <defn>DDC</defn> this number represents a
      <emph>non-binding, suggested DC</emph>  for the GM, for a <emph>typical</emph> check for
      this ability.  The GM can look at see Table<ref>table:std-check-dcs</ref> on
      page<pageref>table:std-check-dcs</pageref> for inspiration when selecting a DC for
      a standard check.

	  <indexentry>Boon</indexentry>
          Whether the check succeeds or not, through skill or luck, the character
          has gained some advantage.  When the character gains a <bold>boon</bold>
          the GM may negotiate with the player to determine the result.  For
          example, the opponent could be pushed back, drop the scroll they are carrying, or
          be forced to make a morale check.  As always the GM is the final arbiter of
          whether a players call is reasonable and he may temper the results of the
  	  success, as he chooses.
        </p>

        <p>
	  <indexentry>Bane</indexentry>
	  When the character gains a Bane, something has gone wrong.  The GM should
	  describe some additional bad outcome for the check, or roll on one of the
	  failure tables for inspiration.
          For example, the character may have struck with the flat of the blade
          (requiring the weapon to make a save), they may have lost their footing,
          left themselves open to attack or dropped some item they were carrying.
          In other words, some adverse affect applies.  The GM should decide
          on an appropriate bane for the character, or roll on
          one of the bane tables for inspiration.
        </p>

        <playexample>
          <p>
  	    Dourli has to make a quick getaway from a burning stable surrounded by
  	    a crossbow wielding gang.  The one horse inside the stable is panicking
  	    because of the fire.
          </p>
	  
          <p>
  	    Dourli attempts to mount the horse and ride to freedom.  Dourli doesn't
  	    have Horsemanship or Animal Husbandry but he does have a fairly good 
  	    Strength.  So Dourli attempts to control the horse using a Strength Ability
  	    Check.  The GM decides that the task has a difficulty of 14, so Dourli must
  	    roll a 14 or more in order to get the horse under control.  Dourli has a
  	    Strength 2, <ie/>he has the Strength ability at rank 2, and so he gets a
	    bonus to his role of +2.  Dourli rolls a pair of
  	    fives on his 2d12, for a total of 10 and adds his Strength Rank of 2 to get 12
	    which isn't enough to make the 14 required to control the horse.   In addition,
	    because he rolled double odds he suffers a bane.  The GM declares that the
	    horse bolts, smashing through the burning stable doors and running into the night.

      <sectiontitle>Types of Check</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	There are many different types of Check.  When choosing which one to use
	the rule of thumb is <emph>use the check most specific ability to the task at hand.
	The less relevant an ability is to a task the harder the DC should be to perform

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Ability Checks</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  Ability Checks are any checks made using an ability.  For example attack rolls are a
	  type of ability check using an appropriate weapon abiliy, as are spell casting checks
	  using the appropriate magic ability.  For these checks the dice used, the modifier
	  and a suggested default difficulty are provided in the ability description.

  	    Dourli attempts to strike a thug with his axe using his Axe Strike 2 ability.
	    He rolls 2d12+2, where the +2 comes from his ability rank, and the difficulty

          </p>
	</playexample>

	<p>
	  Many abilities can be used even if the PC has no rank in that ability.  When using an
	  untrained ability the character uses the Untrained Rank of the ability in the check.
	  The untrained ability rank is often -3, but you need to check the ability for more
	  information.   Everyone is trained in their Primary Abilities.

          <indexentry>Primary Ability Check</indexentry>
          Primary Ability Checks are ability check, made using one of
	  the characters primary abilities, Strength, Endurance, Agility, etc.   Primary Ability
	  checks are usually used when no more specific check can be applied, <eg/> a character
	  might check their agility when trying to catch a falling object as there is no catch ability.
	  To check whether a character can  make it to shore from a sinking ship should be made using
	  the Swim ability and not the endurance primary ability, since the Swim ability is more specific
	  in this case.
	</p>
	
	<playexample>
          <p>
  	    Dourli tries to shift a large wine barrel that is sitting on a trap door
  	    in a cellar.  The GM declares that in order to do so Dourli must make a Strength
  	    Check with a difficulty of 12.  The player rolls a 4 and a 5 on their 2d12.
  	    Dourli has Strength 2, and so gets a bonus of +2 for a total of 11.  Dourli
  	    fails to move the wine barrel.  If he had a Strength 3 he would have succeeded.

	<p>
          <indexentry>Checks<subentry>Encumbrance</subentry></indexentry>
          <indexentry>Encumbrance Check</indexentry>
          Encumbrance is an optional rule.  The characters Encumbrance is a DC that
	  players can be forced to check against when the characters are doing something
          where the weight of their pack could be a problem, <eg/> characters climbing a
	  mountain may be made to make an Endurance check against their encumbrance or
	  become exhausted.  Encumbrance does not simply represent weight, it also represents
	  the unwieldiness of the items being carried; how awkward it is to move while
	  carrying the item.	  
	</p>

	<playexample>
          <p>
  	    Dourli tries to walk across a rope between two buildings.  He rolls a success
	    with a bane.  The GM rules that Dourli falls, but catches the rope under his
	    arms.  The GM decides that Dourli must now make an Agility Check against his
	    Encumberance DC or drop an item.  Dourli rolls a 2 and 1, +0 for his Agility Rank,
	    and fails miserably.  There is no point calculating Dourli's Encumberance, he has
	    clearly failed.  The GM rules that this means that unfortunately, Dourli drops
	    the gemstone he has just acquired into the canal below.
          </p>
	</playexample>
	
	<p>
	  In order to use encumbrance you should be using the standard character sheets.
	  In the equipment section of the character sheet, marked against the side, are
	  encumbrance values for each class of item (small, medium and large) and values
	  for armour and coin.  The total of these values is the characters encumbrance.
	  Note that you do not count items twice (<eg/> a shield may be a large object in
	  practice but its encumbrance is counted separately because of the encumbrance
	  values for armour)
	</p>

	<p>
	  If you are going to use Encumberance then it is important that this rule does
	  not become a long-winded exercise in accounting.  First roll the check, then
	  calculate the encumbrance (if required). Secondly, don't worry about getting
	  the value exactly right - it will take to long. Just eye-ball it.  Finally
	  only bother calculating encumberance on demand, when the value is required.

	<subsectiontitle>Converting from Ranks to DCs</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  It is often useful for the GM to convert back and forth between a Std Check DC and a
	  Std Check Bonus.  In this way the GM can quickly change who rolls the die for a check,
	  and can make opposed checks between two abilities.  It is the GM's prerogative how a
	  check is made, and who rolls for a check.
	</p>

	<p>
  	  To convert from an Ability to a DC we simple add 13 to the Ability Rank, since the
	  average value of 2d12 roll is 13.  Alternatively, we can convert from a DC back to
	  an Ability Bonus we deduct 13 from the DC.

          In an <defn>Opposed DC Check</defn> instead of checking against a DC chosen by the GM,

	  very common type of check, <eg/> many combat checks are Opposed DC Checks.
	</p>
	
	<playexample>
          <p>
  	    Dourli strikes at an assassin with his Axe Strike 2 ability.  Dourli checks against one
	    of his opponents Defence DCs, in this case the GM chooses the assassin's Dodge 3 skill,
	    which is converted to a DC of 16 (a base of 13, +3 for the Dodge Rank).  Dourli rolls a 3
	    and a 12, +2 for his rank in Axe Strike, for a total of 17.    Dourli hits the Assassin.

	<p>
	  In a Hidden DC check the GM does not tell the players what the DC of the check is.
	  Hidden DC checks are used when the GM does not want the player to have complete
	  certainty about the success of their check.  
	</p>
	
	<playexample>
  	  <p>
	    Dourli attempts to tell Emrich, the head of the local thieves guild, that he has no
	    idea about a gemstone that recently went missing, the GM decides that this will be
	    hard with a DC of 16 but keeps this secret because this is a Hidden DC Check, Dourli
	    makes checks his Decieve 2 ability and rolls a 4 and a 10. Dourli does not know whether
	    he succeeded but knows his check was not too bad.  However, Emrich is the sort that
	    plays his cards close to his chest.  Had Dourli rolled a total of 3 then he could be
	    reasonably sure he failed, similarly had he rolled a 20 he could be reasonably sure he
	    succeeded.

	<p>
	  In a Hidden Check when the character makes a check the GM rolls for the opposing ability
	  check and keeps the result secret.  Hidden DC checks are used when the GM does not want
	  the player to have more uncertainty about the success or failure of their check.
	</p>
	
	<playexample>
  	  <p>
	    Dourli searches a wooden box for traps.  The chest/trap has a Decieve 3 ability.  Dourli does
	    not have the Trapwork skill so he checks with a -3 untrained bonus.  The GM secretly rolls
	    a 4 and an 11, +3 for the Rank in Decieve, for a total of 18 for the box.  Dourli rolls two 10s,
	    with -3 for the untrained rank bonus, for a total of 17.  Dourli does not find the trap,
	    but because of the Boon rolled, the GM decides that Dourli hears a soft clicking sound
	    from within, whenever the box is turned upside down.

  	  Sometimes the GM wants to make a check without the players knowing whether
	  a check has been made.  A common example of this is the Passive Perception Check.
	  The only difference between Secret Checks and other sorts of Check is that the GM
	  rolls the dice for the check instead of the player, and the GM does not let the
	  players know what he is doing.

	    Dourli wanders into an alley looking to find an old acquaintance.   Unbeknownst

	    earlier.  The GM decides to make a secret Passive Perception Check to see if Dourli
	    notices that there has been a struggle here.  The GM chooses a DC of 13 for check, by fiat.
	    Then, using Dourli's Perception 1 ability, the GM rolls two 9s and adds +1 for Dourlis
	    Perception Rank.  Since 19 is greater than the DC of 13, Dourli succeeds and notices that
	    a struggle has occurred.  However, since a Bane was rolled the GM determines that Dourli
	    cannot determine how long ago the stuggle occurred or any other useful information.

      <sectiontitle>Aspect Checks</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	Role-playing is shared story-telling.  Conflict and struggle are central to a 
	good story.  Aspects are the mechanic that we use to represent facets of the 
	characters personality that can be used to create interesting, non-physical,
	internal or inter-personal conflict and character development within the game.
      </p>

      <p>
	<indexentry>Aspects</indexentry> 
	Aspect checks are a special type of Ability Check.  They describe some part of a
	characters personality, their system of beliefs, or their philosophy of life. There are many
	types of aspects.  They fall loosely into the following categories:
      </p>
      
      <descriptions>
	<term>Personality Aspects</term>
	<description>
          <p>
	    describe some part of a characters personality or demeanour, their flaws and
	    foibles, their short-comings, their weaknesses and sometimes their strengths,
	    <eg/> Mama's Boy, As Exciting as Cold Oatmeal, Plagued by Self-Doubt.
          </p>
	</description>

	<term>Philosophy Aspects</term>
	<description>
          <p>
	    encode a character's beliefs and their moral compass: Defender of the 
	    Downtrodden, Man of the Book, Death before Dishonour.
          </p>
	</description>

	<term>Relationship Aspects</term>
	<description>
          <p>
	    Relationship aspects can be used to describe a close bond between the
	    character and an individual, a magic item, their god, a small group or even
	    a large population.  In the last case it comes in the form of fame, or
	    infamy, with aspects like Hero of Bad Dunmharaiodh, Emissary of the Elf Council,
	    Beholden to the Black Hand, or The Scourge of the Serpent People.

	<subsectiontitle>Choosing Good Aspects</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  Aspects are used to drive conflict in the game.  If the character is
	  a <emph>Problem Gambler</emph> have the party visiting gambling dens so
	  the character has to suffer an internal struggle not to gamble and
	  have some thugs lean on the character to pay back his debts.
	</p>

	<p>
          Good aspects are evocative of the characters personality, their belief system 
          or their social status. They should not describe parts of the game already covered 
          by existing game mechanics.  For example, <emph>Greatest Swordsman Ever</emph> is 
          not a good aspect - it interferes with the game rules on combat.  <emph>Thinks He's
          the Greatest Swordsman Ever</emph> is much better because it establishes the 
          character as a braggadocio or self-delusional.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Remember that the Aspects should be chosen to create conflict and problems for the
	  characters to overcome.  If an Aspect does not cause the character to overcome
	  difficulties or make interesting decisions it is not a good aspect. As a general
	  rule good aspects are phrases that when applied require action from the character.
	  Additionally they should be neither too specific or too general.  For good example
	  aspects see Figure<ref>figure:random-aspect-table</ref> on
          page<pageref>table:{{ doc_name }}-random-aspects</pageref>.

          <indexentry>Aspect Creation</indexentry> 
	  Before choosing aspects we suggest discussing the role playing milieu with the GM.
	  Get a feel for the colour of the world and the NPCs and organizations within it.  Then
	  <emph>with the other players, together as a group</emph>, choose one aspect with the GM
	  that ties your character to one of these NPCs or organizations, or one of the player
	  characters.  Then choose a Personality or Philosophy based aspect for your character.
	  You just write these on your character sheet in the Aspects section with a starting rank
	  of 1.

	<subsectiontitle>Compelling and Resisting Aspects</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
          <indexentry>Compelling an Aspect</indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Aspect<subentry>Compel</subentry></indexentry> 
          Any player, including the GM, may attempt to <defn>Compel</defn> any characters
	  aspect at any time, this includes a player compelling their own PC.  Compelling aspects
	  involves suggesting to a player that their character should follow a course of action in
	  keeping with one of their aspects.  The GM should agree that the aspect can be compelled
	  in the given context, and then the player may choose to <bold>accept</bold> or
	  <bold>resist</bold> the compel.
	</p>

	<p>
          If the player <emph>accepts a compel</emph> for an aspect then they should have 
          their character behave in accordance with that aspect.  Alternatively, players may
	  have their characters try to <emph>resist the compel</emph>.  When doing so they roll
	  a Std Check against a default DC of 15.  
	  If the check is successful they <emph>resist the compel</emph>, their character's
	  behaviour is not bound by the aspect, and they gain a Rank in that Aspect.  If they do
	  <emph>not</emph> resist the compel then their character's behaviour is bound by the
	  compel.
          <equation>
            <line>Aspect Check:</line>
            <line>Std 2d12 + Aspect Rank<geqqsymbol/> 15</line>
          </equation>		  
	</p>     
	
	<p>
	  When the check is successful the Character who makes the successful
	  check promotes this aspect, and  whoever compelled the aspect may recharge a
	  die into their Luck or Mettle Pool.
	</p>

	<p>
	  When a Boon is rolled in an aspect check the following things happen something fortuitous
	  happens.  When a Bane is rolled something bad happens.
	</p>

	<playexample>
          <p>
	    Dourli hears that Emrich, of the Red Knives, has offered 20gp for information 
	    about one of Dourli's colleagues.  A second player might decide to try to compel Dourli,
	    as Dourli has an aspect <emph>Gold is my Lodestone 1</emph>.  The player then decides 
	    whether he will accept the compel and provide the information about his associate
	    or try to resist the compel.
          </p>
          
          <p>
	    He decides to resist.  So he has to make an Aspect Check.  He rolls 
	    2d12 and rolls two 4s, plus 1 for the aspects rank, for a total of 9.  Dourli fails 
	    the check, as the total is lower than the DC for Aspect Checks of 15.  So now Dourli has 
	    to provide the information about his associate in order to garner his well earned 
	    gold.  
          </p>
          
          <p>
	    Dourli now decides that he cannot, 
	    just hand over the information about his associate, like a despicable cad, and 
	    instead resolves to try and sell them bogus information.  This action satisfies 
	    the compel as, if he succeeds, he still gets his gold.  Whether this approach
	    succeeds or not is resolved separately, perhaps using a Deceive check.  Because
	    Dourli rolled a Boon during his check, something good happens, the GM might rule
	    that the Emrich is receptive to Dourli's false information, maybe due to
	    confirmation bias? This might be reflected by giving the Decieve check a lower
	    DC, or maybe granting Dourli advantage on the Decieve check.
          </p>

	<subsectiontitle>Reevaluating Aspects</subsectiontitle>
	<indexentry>Reevaluating Aspects</indexentry> 
	<indexentry>Aspect<subentry>Reevaluation</subentry></indexentry>

	<p>
	  Aspects can be <defn>Reevaluated</defn> for two reasons.  The first is that
	  the Aspect is not working in the game in a way that makes the GM or the player happy,
	  <eg/> this might be because the Aspect is never used, or the behaviour the aspect compels
	  do not align with the players view of their character.  The second reason is that
	  the Aspect has reached a Rank of 4.  <bold>Aspects must be reevaluated when the Aspects
	  Rank reaches 4.</bold> At this point the character has concluded this stage
	  of their character arc.  If the Aspect was interesting then a new Aspect can be chosen
	  based on the original aspect, that has the character evolve and grow over time.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  When reevaluating aspects any number of aspects can be retired, reworded, replaced with
	  a new, completely different aspect, or perhaps the character simple gains a new
	  additional aspect entirely.
	</p>

	<p>
	  When reevaluating aspects remember that the point of aspects in the game is to drive
	  the story and character development.  If an aspect is not being used frequently, or if
	  it is being overused, or abused, if it has just become a little tired, if there is an
	  opportunity to represent character growth or move the character through some character
	  arc, then now is the time to consider making changes to the characters aspects.
	</p>

	<playexample>
	  <p>
	    Much later, Dourli's aspect <emph>Gold is my Lodestone 4</emph> finally reaches a rank of 4.
	    At this point the aspect should be reevaluated.  If his aspects are working
	    well in the game, leading to enjoyable game play, then Dourli might make a subtle change to
	    the aspect, maybe softening the wording of this aspect to, something like,
	    <emph>If you give a Man a Sword he can Rob a Bank, if you give him a Bank he can Rob the
	    World 1</emph>, which is a little less proscriptive.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Maybe Dourli has had an epiphany?  He has realized the error of his ways, wasting his life
	    in the pursuit of filthy lucre, and so he replaces the <emph>Gold is my Lodestone 4</emph>
	    aspect with a new aspect, <emph>I am a River to My People 1</emph>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Finally, Dourli might decide to choose a new aspect altogether.  Maybe choosing a new
	    aspect all together <emph>You Must be the Change you Wish to See in the World 1</emph>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    In any case the decision should be opened up to the table for input and debate.
	  </p>
	</playexample>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Conflicting Aspects</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
          Sometimes a characters aspects conflict with one another.  In such cases 
          someone can compel one aspect to try and gain a bonus on a second
          aspect check.
	</p>

	<playexample>
	  <p>
	    Suppose the GM tries to compel Dourli's <emph>Gold is My Lodestone 1</emph>
	    aspect to make Dourli sell out one of his companions.  Dourli may counter that
	    he has sworn friendship with the companion while imbibing and that the
	    GM's compel conflicts with another one of his aspects <emph>My Word as a Dwarf 2</emph>.
	    In such cases the GM should grant the player some advantage to the
	    <emph>Gold is My Lodestone 1</emph> check.  As a general rule, it is not a good idea
	    to allow a character to have aspects that are too contradictary.
	  </p>
	</playexample>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Vetoing an Aspect</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  At the end of the day the player's character is his own.  The GM and other
	  players should not force the player to make his character take an aspect,
	  or behave in a way they do not want.  The player may always veto newly
	  proposed aspects for their character or suggested actions for a compelled
	  aspect.  Players should use this veto power only when they really dislike
	  the outcome of a compelled aspect.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Permanent Aspects</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  Some disabilities or afflications can be modelled, in game, using aspects.
	  These aspects may or may not be permanent.  For this kind of aspect the GM
	  can rule that the aspect is never reevaluated.  Permanent aspects have some
	  maximum rank beyond which the character cannot improve.  The upper limit for
	  the rank of permanent aspects should be determined by the GM on a per aspect
	  basis.  The higher the maximum rank the less of an impediment the aspect will
	  become with time.
	</p>

	<playexample>
	  <p>
	    Dourli comes into some unexpected wealth.  He decides to go and celebrate
	    at the local tavern.  The GM asks him to roll a Generic Check to give an
	    indication of what happens.  Unfortunately Dourli rolls a double 1.  The
	    GM decides that Dourli looses his left hand in an unfortunate axe throwing
	    incident.  Dourli gains the <emph>Missing Left Hand 1</emph> aspect.  The GM
	    determines that this is a permanent aspect and that it has a maximum rank of
	    7.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Later Dourli, finds himself climbing over a roof.  He fails the Climb roll and
	    starts to slip.   The GM determines that now might be a good time to make a
	    <emph>Missing Left Hand 1</emph>  check.  Dourli fails and so slips off the roof.
	    He makes a last minute Agility Check and is left hanging from the gutter by his
	    right hand.

      <indexentry>Dice Pool Check</indexentry>
      <indexentry>Check<subentry>Dice Pool</subentry></indexentry>
      Dice pools represent some finite resource that will run out if overused,
      <eg/> for player characters these are Magic, Mettle and Luck, but monsters, magic items,
      and other things can have dice pools as well.  When the player has to make a dice pool check
      they <emph>choose one or more d6s</emph> from their dice pool and
      roll them to try and get a result greater than or equal to a given difficulty or DC.
      <equation>
        <line>Dice Pool Check:</line>
        <line>nD6 + Ability Rank <geqqsymbol/>DC - Modifiers</line>
      </equation>

    <p>
      <indexentry>Dice Pool Check<subentry>Exhaustion</subentry></indexentry>
      <indexentry>Check<subentry>Dice Pool Exhaustion</subentry></indexentry>
      Doubles have no special effect in Dice Pool Checks.  However, when a dice rolls low,
      that dice is said to be <defn>Exhausted</defn>.  For most dice pool checks, and <bold>unless
      otherwise stated, dice in a dice pool are exhausted when they roll a two or less</bold>.
      Though exhaustion for magic dice pools is more complicated, and magic dice may be
      exhausted at even higher values depending on the context of the casting, see the
      rules of magic for more information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Players start the game with full dice pools. During the game they may lose dice from
      those pools through exhaustion,	and they may return dice to their pools using various
      means including by resting.
    </p>

      <indexentry>Dice Pool Check<subentry>Control</subentry></indexentry>
      <indexentry>Check<subentry>Control</subentry></indexentry>
      Magic is fickle and hard to control.  To represent this each spell has an overcharge value.
      If the number of 6s rolled is greater than or equal to the overcharge for the spell then
      the caster loses control of the spell.  Overcharging does not effect the success or failure
      of the spell.  Whether the spell overcharges or not the spell only succeeds if the sum of the
      magic pool is greater than or equal to the spells DC. The spell is said to be <defn>Overcharged</defn>.
      See the rules of magic for more information and the table of Magic Modifiers,
      Table<ref>figure:{{ doc_name }}-magic-modifiers</ref>, for further details.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The PC dice pools: <emph>Magic, Mettle and Luck dice are restored to the pool by resting</emph>
      or through the use of special abilities.  For other dice pools, <eg/> some magic item
      magic pools, exhausted dice can never be replaced, others dice pools will have their own
      replacement schedule. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The number of dice in a characters dice pools are defined by their archetype, level
      and abilities. 	For character dice pools like Luck, Magic and Mettle the dice pools
      will have a rest rate which allows the player to return dice to his dice pool over time or
      when certain events occur.  For magical items and other dice pool checks the loss
      might be permanent.  Exhaustion only applies to Dice Pool Checks, not Std Checks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <indexentry>Dice Pool Check<subentry>Shared Dice Pools</subentry></indexentry>
      <indexentry>Shared Dice Pool</indexentry>
      Some checks will allow the use of a <emph>Shared Pool of Dice</emph>.  In this case the dice to be
      used are selected from all the pools before the check.  Then all the selected dice are
      rolled simultaneously but are kept separate.   The check succeeds or fails based on
      the sum of all the dice rolled. Dice are exhausted from the pool from whence the die came.
      Characters do not decide which pools to exhaust dice from.
    </p>

    <p>
      <indexentry>Dice Pool Check<subentry>Empty</subentry></indexentry>
      <indexentry>Empty Dice Pool</indexentry>
      When a dice pool is empty, <ie/> it has had all its dice exhausted, any further
      checks made against that pool automatically fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      <indexentry>Dice Pool Check<subentry>Modifiers</subentry></indexentry>
      <indexentry>Modifier to a Dice Pool Check</indexentry>
      Like a Std Check, a Dice Pool Check can have modifiers.  These modifiers effect the DC for
      the check and are suggestions for the GM.  For example a +1 DC modifier <emph>reduces</emph> a
      dice pools checks difficulty by one, making the check easier.  A -1 DC modifier makes the check harder.
    </p>


    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Mettle Checks<label>sec:mettle-checks</label></sectiontitle>
      <p>
	<indexentry>Mettle Checks</indexentry>
        <indexentry>Checks<subentry>Mettle (PCs)</subentry></indexentry>
	Player characters may, from time to time, be forced to make a Mettle Check.	
        Mettle Checks occur when characters have to face their fears.
	Only Player Characters make Mettle Checks, NPCs and monsters make Morale Checks instead.
      </p>
      <p>
	A typical <defn>Mettle Check</defn> is a <emph>Mettle Dice Pool check</emph>
	made against a DC of 5.  When a character fails a Mettle Check another neraby character,
	chosen at random or by the GM, must also make a Mettle Check.  Mettle checks can continue
	to cascade until someone succeeds or everyone has failed a Mettle Check.  Mettle Checks are
	free actions.
	<equation>
	  <line>Mettle Check:</line>
	  <line>Mettle Pool<ltsymbol/> DC 5</line>
	</equation>      
      </p>

      <p>
	The GM should feel free to modify the Mettle Check DC as he pleases, <ie/>
	to reflect being attacked at night, being vastly outnumbered, the horrible
	visage of the characters opponents, the party being in good spirits etc.
	As characters fail Mettle Checks the party starts to lose dice from their Mettle
	Pools and their fighting options become somewhat diminished.
      </p>

      <p>
	Some suggested times to make Mettle Checks are:
	<list>
	  <li>Whenever a party member becomes Bloodied,</li>
	  <li>When the party enters combat against a Fear causing opponent,</li>
	  <li>Whenever the party is Surprised or Ambushed.</li>
	</list>
	Ultimately, however, it is up to the GMs discretion to decide when the players should
	make a Mettle check and the GM should feel free to force resolve checks sooner or later
	in the combat to satisfy the narrative imperative.	  
      </p>

      <p>
	The first time the group collectively fails a Mettle Check then everyone gains the Checked
	Condition see page<pageref>condition:checked</pageref>, after the second time everyone fails
	a Mettle Check everyone gains the Broken Condition, see page<pageref>condition:broken</pageref>.
	The third time the group fails their Mettle Check they gain the Routed Condition, see
	page<pageref>condition:routed</pageref>.

      <sectiontitle>Magic Checks</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	<indexentry>Magic</indexentry>
	Magic infuses this and all worlds.  It links and binds all things, tying entities 
	together and creating invisible bonds between the planes.  The utilization of magic
	is concerned with controlling the flow of thaumaturgical energies along these paths.
	Magic appears to be goverened by well known principles and is as much a science 
	as Physicks, Mathematics, Theosophy, Astrology, Phrenology or even Biology.  However,
	due to the chaotic nature of thaumic energies the application of these laws
	is unreliable, and frequently dangerous.  
      </p>

      <p>
	The basic principles of magic are as follows:    
      </p>
      <descriptions>
	<term>Law of Potentials</term>
	<description>
	  In order for magic to occur there must be a difference in thaumaturgical 
	  potentials, a high potential and a low potential.
	</description>

	<term>Law of Flux</term>
	<description>
	  Magic occurs when thaumaturgical energies flow from a high potential to a 
	  low potential along a line of flux.
	</description>

	<term>Law of Conductivity</term>
	<description>
	  Lines of magical flux may be created, broken or enhanced using a variety of techniques.
	  Different materials conduct magical energies better than others.
	</description>

	<term>Law of Contagion</term>
	<description>
	  As magic shapes all things it follows logically that similar things are linked by the
	  lines of flux that created them.  The relationship between things can be used to gain
	  more control over magic.
	</description>

	<term>Law of Knowledge</term>
	<description>
	  The more you know about a subject the greater your knowledge about the 
	  lines of flux that bind them, and the more power you have over them.  This can be
	  considered to be a corollary of the Law of Contagion.
	</description>
      </descriptions>
      
      <p>
	Later in this chapter we explore in more depth how the fundamental laws of magic effect casting.

	<subsectiontitle>Casting Spells</subsectiontitle>
	
	<p>
	  <label>sec:magic-dice</label>
	  Mechanically, magical spells are abilities.  Casting magic uses a pool of magic dice, and
	  magic checks are dice pool checks.  Characters that do not cast spells also have a magic pool 
	  that represents their life-energy, their animus.  Non-casting characters will have no
	  magic abilities that use their magic pool.  However their magic pools can be used as a 
	  a defence against certain magical effects.  Specialized magic casting characters will have
	  larger magic dice pools, greater energy, and a variety of skills that allow them to use that pool.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Follow these steps to cast a spell:
	</p>
	<descriptions>
	  <term>Roll Magic Check</term>
	  <description>The player chooses any number of dice from their pool
	  and rolls them and sums the face values of the dice to get a result.</description>
	  <term>Check Success</term>
	  <description>If the sum of the magic dice is less than the difficulty then the spell is 
	  under-powered, sputters out and fails without further effect.   If the result is greater or equal to 
	  the difficulty the spell check succeeds and the spell is cast.  The spells effects apply now.
	  <equation>
	    <line>Difficulty <leqqsymbol/> Result + Ability Rank</line>
	  </equation>    
	  </description>    
	  <term>Check Overcharge</term>
	  <description>
	    Thematically an overcharge occurs when the caster
	    embues a spell with too much power and the extra theurgical energies become too great for the caster
	    to handle, the caster loses control over the casting and the extra energies must be disipated somehow.
	    Mechanically, an overcharge occurs if the number of sixes rolled in the check exceeds the spells
	    overcharge value.  Armour can effect spell overcharge, see the table of Magic Modifiers,
	    Table<ref>figure:{{ doc_name }}-magic-modifiers</ref>,  for details.
	    At that point a range of strange and usually bad things can happen.  The GM
	    determines an overcharge effect based on the spells overcharge information and possibly referring to
	    Table<ref>figure:{{ doc_name }}-overcharge-effects</ref> for some suggested overcharge effects to
	    inspire the GM.

	<subsectiontitle>Principles of Magic (Optional)</subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  Magical checks are affected by the complex, chaotic nature of thaumaturgic
	  energies.  We now explain the laws of magic, which describe how magic is effected by
	  context and circumstance.  But the reader should beware; magic is a dark art; those
	  who play with the devil's toys will be brought by degrees to wield his sword.
	</p>

	
	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>The Law of Potentials</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    The first law of magic is that <indexentry>Rules of Magic<subentry>First</subentry></indexentry>
	    <emph>magic requires a potential difference in energy levels as a prerequisite</emph>.
	    Furthermore, <indexentry>Rules of Magic<subentry>Second</subentry></indexentry>
	    <emph>the productive use of magic requires the construction of a thaumaturgical 
	    conduit between potentialities</emph> through which magical energies can flow. 
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    There are many different sources of thaumaturgical potentialities, such as the 
	    potential difference between planes of existance, energy from stored thaumaturgical
	    sources, the animus (a person or animals spark of life) and so on.  We examine the most
	    important, and the most widely used, of these potentialities here.
	  </p>

	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Raw/Planar Magical Sources</subsubsubsectiontitle>
	    <p>
	      Planar Magicks are those that use the raw potential differences between two
	      planes directly, these so-called Protinus magics, are the most powerful, the
	      most volatile, and most dangerous of the magical sources to use.  Casters
	      attempt to harness the flow from planes of higher energy to planes of
	      lower energy.  There are two main dangers to using this form of thatumaturgical
	      energy.  The first is its volatility. Casters using this energy source are more
	      likely to overcharge their spells.  The second danger are the lurkers in the dark.
	      There are a myriad of creatures lurking in the frigid abyssal planes who hunger
	      eternally to escape to higher planes and feed indiscriminately.  They wait for the
	      opportunity a miscast might provide.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	      <defn>Elemental Magic</defn> is a subset of planar magic that uses the potential
	      between a particular set of well-known planes of existance, the so-called
	      elementatal planes.  The advantage of this energy source is that these planes are
	      comparatively stable and their behaviour is fairly well-understood.  Unfortunately,
	      elemental magic is less	versatile than, the more general, planar magic.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      If a magical act uses extra-planar differentials, and the flow of energies
	      is from this plane to some other lower 
	      potential plane then energies are expended from this plane, the temperature  
	      drops, lights dim and ice may form.  We call such an action an endothaumic 
	      reaction.  In contradistinction, if energy flows to this plane from some higher 
	      plane then the magic is of a type named exothaumic and the tell-tale side effects 
	      of such practice are bright lights, heat are sometimes smoke of a sulfurous nature.
	      No other magic sources have such side-effects.

	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Magic Items and their Power Sources</subsubsubsectiontitle>
	    <p>
	      Magical items typically use thaumaturgical energies stored within the device itself.
	      Magic by its very nature is evanescent - it has a tendency to dissipate after
	      a period of time.  Magical items, therefore, tend to be made of thaumic insulating
	      materials in order to minimize the rate at which magic is dissipated.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      In game, this stored magical potential is representated by some magical devices
	      having their own magic pool and refresh rates.  The item used to store magical energies
	      may be one use, rechargeable or self recharging.  One use magic items will have no
	      refresh rate.  When a one-use items dice pool is depleted the device is spent.
	    </p>

	      <term>Runic Magic</term>
	      <description>
		<p>
		  are essentially spells that automatically cast 
		  themselves when a certain triggering event occurs, <ie/> the runes are read or
		  touched.  The effects of runic magic are typically limited to the vicinity of the
		  runes.
		</p>

		<p>
		  The small amount of magic required to cast the runespell is stored in the runes 
		  themselves when they are created.  Overtime this magic will leach from the rune
		  and it will no longer be viable, but may still be replenished by a skilled
		  Runemaster.  Depleted runic magic will have limited or even no effect.
		  For this reason runes are typically carved into materials which are
		  highly thaumaturgically non-conductive such as ferrous metals or rock.  Once the
		  runespell is cast it behaves as any other spell, drawing the energy for the spell
		  itself from some second source.  For runes carved in stone, glass and steel this
		  is almost always from the elemental planes of earth as the spells powers are
		  enhanced by the contagious nature of the substrate.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Magical swords, armour, rings and the like are typically runic in nature.
		  See Section<ref>sec:attunement</ref> on page<pageref>sec:attunement</pageref>

	      <description>
		<p>	     
		  contain the written incantations that must be entoned to cast a spell <label>sec:scrolls</label>.
		  They often also contain background thaumic theory, notes on the casters experiences with casting
		  the spell, other bits of information relevant to the spell, and sometimes bits of information
		  completely irrelevant to the spell.  Unlike runes they do not contain any magical energies with
		  which to automatically trigger or power the spell instead drawing their energy from
		  the readers magic pool.  Most scrolls are written in Inochian, though some
		  are written in languages like Aquillonian, Lagashi, and Fey, and the caster must be able to read
		  from the scroll to cast it.  These requirements make scrolls difficult for non-casters to use.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Scrolls may be used in the following ways: a caster may cast a spell from a scroll, or
		  they may learn that spell from that scroll, or both.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  <emph>When casting a spell from a scroll the caster must first make a successful language
		  check in the language that the scroll is written in to read the scroll</emph>.  If they
		  fail then the spell is not cast and no magic energy is
		  expended.  If they fail with a boon they receive +3 to the next attempt.  If they
		  fail with a bane they must expend an extra magic die after the spell is cast.  If they
		  succeed with a boon they may add or subtract 3 to their roll or return a magic die exhausted
		  in the casting to their magic pool.  <emph>After reading the scroll
		  the spell is cast normally using the casters own magic pool as a a rank 0 ability</emph>.
		  Casting spells at 0 rank overrides the spells normal rank so if a spell has a
		  minimum rank of 1 then it can still be cast at 0 rank from a scroll.
		</p>

		<p>
		  A caster may learn a spell from a scroll given time to study it, and with the use of an 
		  ability promotion of the appropriate rank.    
		</p>

		<p>
		  Scrolls may be reused unless they become damaged, or the creator has written some
		  limiting clause into the scroll.  This may be done in order to reduce the danger
		  of misuse or limit competition with the creator.  A common example of scroll
		  limitation is to include a glyph of destruction in the scroll so that it may not
		  be used more than once and cannot be learned.  Another example, are cursed scrolls
		  designed as a trap to protect the author's trade secrets from others.  Note that the
		  proliferation of magic is seen as a dangerous thing.  Their unfettered use is frowned
		  upon and policed by both the College of Mages and the Witchhunters.

		At the best of times potions have a limited shelf-life.  However, the energy stored

	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>The Animus</subsubsubsectiontitle>
	    
	    <p>
	      <indexentry>animus</indexentry>
	      Every living creature is imbued with a store of thaumic energy within and of
	      themselves, their <emph>Animus</emph>.  This is why even non-magical archetypes
	      have a magic pool.   This energy is used by a number of 
	      forms of magic, the most widely know examples are: necromantic draining, blood 
	      magic, death curses, and human sacrifices.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      It has been postulated that the phenomenon of life is the flow of magical power 
	      from some higher plane through to some lower plane.  In such a model the body is
	      the conduit through which magical energies flow.  An alternate
	      model holds that living creatures are wellsprings of magical energies, <ie/> that
	      they are the sources of magical energies themselves.  A third model holds that both
	      of the first two models hold true.  Which of these models, if any, are correct
	      remains an extremely contentious area of debate amongst scholars of the dark arts.
	      In any case, it is widely believed that their exists an animatic flow that is
	      replenishes the animus from some source.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      The rate of the animatic flow is proportional to the strength of emotions that 
	      the living creature is feeling.  For this reason many thaumatergical predators 
	      will enhance these emotions while feeding.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Further, it has been hypothesized that apparations, ghosts, banshees and other
	      spiritual manifestions are the remnants of powerful residual animatic flow.  They
	      are the eddies in the animatic flow, left by the passing of highly magical or highly
	      emotive creatures.
	    </p>
	  </subsubsubsection>

	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>The Biome</subsubsubsectiontitle>
	    <p>
	      Rather than draw magical power from a particular animus, some animistic casters,
	      such as	Druids, are able to draw very small amounts of magic from all surrounding
	      living creatures.  While very powerful these magics can be difficult to use if the
	      biome is not in balance. 
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Wild magic is effected by the environment in which it is cast.  In biomes with a
	      great deal of balanced animistic energy, forests, swamps etc, Wild Magic spells
	      receive a +1 DC modifier.  In cities and deserts wild magic suffers a -1 DC
	      modifier.
	    </p>
	  </subsubsubsection>


	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Channelled Magic</subsubsubsectiontitle>
	    <p>
	      Theurgic, Channelled, or Sponsored Magic is magic whose power has been channelled 
	      from a third party one of the so-called ``gods'', demons or celestial agents.  It is 
	      assumed that the caster of channeled magic is using a shared ``holy'' symbol to
	      establish or strengthen the conduit between a caster and the third-party source.  In
	      this type of magic the caster typically acts as	an agent for the third-party, allowing
	      the third-party to project their power and their influence.  See
	      Section<ref>sec:holy-symbol</ref> on page<pageref>sec:holy-symbol</pageref>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Those with an enquiring mind may be wondering where the third-party gets their
	      energy from.  It seems clear that many gain their power from planar magics.
	      For these 'gods' it has been surmised that the act of prayer forms a 
	      conduit with the god through which some small part of the devotees animus travels.
	      Thus people pray to a god,  the god gains animus,  the god grants power to clerics
	      to project the gods interest, the clerics use this power to protect those of their
	      faith and convert new devotees, .. and so on.  Though, this is just a theory and
	      such musings are clearly not meant for mere mortals such as ourselves.  Many
	      religions have also practiced sacrifice as a faster and simpler way of providing
	      animatic energies to their deity.
	    </p>

	  <subsubsectiontitle>The Law of Flux</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    In order for magic to happen thaumic energies must flow, as water must flow for
	    a water mill to grind flour.  
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Stopping the flow stops the magic.  Hindering the flow hinders the magic.
	    <bold>To use magic there must be a potential difference and a flow.</bold>  Certain
	    magical symbols, chiefly the pentagram and the circle, when carved, drawn or laid out
	    upon the ground in salt will stop the flow of magic (salt is used because it is
	    non-conductive, granular, common, cheap, and white.. which makes it easier to see
	    any discontinuities in the symbols).
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    An alternate problem happens when there is too much conductivity.  In practice
	    this happens most often when there is too much water around, e.g. when it rains, or
	    when the caster is standing in water.  Here the caster is likely to dissipate more
	    energy than they otherwise would.  In practice this means that dice are exhausted
	    on rolls higher than the usual value.  In rain the exhaust value increases by one,
	    if you are standing in water (above your ankles) the exhaust value increases by two,
	    if you are swimming the exhaust value increases by three.  For example, typically,
	    magic dice are exhausted on a roll of 1 or 2.  If the character is standing knee-deep
	    in "water" in a sewer they exhaust dice on a roll of 4 or less.  If they cast a four
	    dice spell and rolled 1, 3, 4, 6 they would exhaust three dice.
	  </p>  
	</subsubsection>

	
	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>The Law of Conductivity</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    Magic shapes and binds all things.  Objects that share similarities are linked by 
	    magical ties.  These ties can be used to strengthen magical spells.  For example, having 
	    the blood or hair of a person can be used to strengthen certain spells when used upon
	    that subject.
	  </p>

	  <wrapimg position="r" id="demon" scale="0.14"/>
	  
	  <p>
	    Different materials affect the flow of magic differently.  Natural and biological 
	    materials such as flesh, wood, and water conduct magic very well.   Ferrous metals 
	    glass, and rock do not conduct magic well and can interfere with its casting in
	    unpredictable ways.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Iron interferes with the flow of magic.  Magical creatures,
	    particularly the Fey, do not like it.  In contrast non-ferrous metals.. Platinum,
	    Gold, Silver, Copper, conduct magic, though scholars are in disagreement as to why
	    these do so, given iron does not.  Silver, is a particularly excellent conductor and
	    so adversely affects those possessed by extra planar entities such as the undead and
	    lycanthropes.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Magical circles break conductivity (and therefore also break contagion).
	    What the circle is made of generally doesn't matter.  Though there are specialized 
	    protective circles for the protection of particular beings that while more 
	    powerful require special ingredients, (e.g. salt for vampires).
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Ferrous armour disrupts the flow of magical energies and adversly affects 
	    grounding.  It is impossible to ground-out magic when wearing armour.
	    Similarly, if using a wooden shafted spear with a ferrous head then only the 
	    lowest die may be removed as the metal head interferes with the thaumaturgical 
	    conductivity of the shaft.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Water, and particularly running water, is an excellent magical channel.
	    Characters casting magic in standing water or casting in the rain exhaust dice
	    from their result on a roll of a 1 or 2.  In running water they exhaust dice on a
	    result of 1-3.  In addition, running water breaks contagion.
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>

	
	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>The Law of Contagion</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    Magical contagion refers to the conduits that exist between similar things.
	    All things are bound by magic, and magic binds all things.  But some things
	    are much more closely bound than others.  These sympathetic ties effect the
	    casting of spells for good or ill.
	  </p>
	  
	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Blood Magic</subsubsubsectiontitle>  
	    <p>
	      The power of <defn>Blood Magic</defn> is derived from thaumaturgical contagion between
	      the blood and the animus of the subject.  Blood magic drains the animus from the subject.
	      This allows necromancers and the like to use someone elses magic pool in spells
	      without	their consent (see the rules for shared magic pools).  Blood for this purpose has to be
	      fresh - remember magic is evanescent.  Casting blood magic without a specially prepared
	      sacrificial dagger, an athamé, is done with a -2 DC Modifier.  You do not have to be a
	      caster to cast blood magic.  Some shamen use their own blood as a potential pool of energy.

	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Symbolic Contagion</subsubsubsectiontitle>  
	    <p>
	      Similar symbols form flux lines connected by contagion.  Ritual use of special
	      patterns can form an association to other locations and other realms.  Holy symbols
	      form conduits between theurgic source, a deity or demon, and the caster.  Shared
	      symbols carved into portals tie one portal end point to another.  Contagion is
	      the motivation for the use of all symbology in magic. .
	    </p>
	  </subsubsubsection>


	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Magical Ingredients</subsubsubsectiontitle>  
	    <p>
	      Magical ingredients are used to bind a spell to its target or purpose
	      or bind a spell to previous castings of that spell.  Theurgical magic users
	      rarely need or use magical ingredients.	Non-theurgical magic
	      casters are assumed to have a small cache of reasonably general purpose
	      spell casting ingredients about their person at most times (mistletoe,
	      salt, spiders web, mandragora, iron powder, coffin nails, adders tongue
	      and the like).  There are enough suitable substitutes for most ingredients
	      that we can assume that the caster is reasonably well stocked with something
	      that will do at any time.  If however the magic caster has had his stock
	      of ingredients removed then his spells will be cast with a -1 DC Modifier.
	      If the ingredients exhibit strong and unusual contagion with the spell in
	      question the GM might grant a +1 DC Modifier to the check.
	    </p>
	  </subsubsubsection>
	  

	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Somatic Hand Gestures</subsubsubsectiontitle>  
	    <p>
	      Spells are usually cast using somatic hand gestures.  These gestures tie
	      the spell to other castings of the same spell in the past and in the future,
	      increasing their power.  Magic Checks are performed with a -3 DC Modifier if
	      the caster does not use somatic hand gestures when casting.
	    </p>
	  </subsubsubsection>


	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Words of Power</subsubsubsectiontitle>
	    <p>
	      <indexentry>Words of Power</indexentry>	
	      Words are the key to magic.  When the first great spell casters,
	      monumentally powerful inter-planar beings, cast their spells they
	      did so while intoning in Innochian, the language of magic.  Intoning
	      the same words forms a contagious link with the original castings
	      and other castings of this spell through time. Magic words may also
	      be used to train the invokers thoughts and to gain the attention of
	      other worldly beings, like ringing a bell in the dark.  Casting a
	      spell without verbally intoning the correct words of power
	      is done so at a -1 DC Modifier.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	      Truely powerful creatures are very strongly bound to their true
	      names.  Knowing the true name of a being is a powerful connection
	      when it comes to casting spells that target that indivdual.
	    </p>
	  </subsubsubsection>

	  
	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Temporal Contagion</subsubsubsectiontitle>  
	    <p>
	      Events that occur at the same time are connected by contagion.  This allows
	      casters to draw on the power of great celestial and planar events, <eg/>
	      eclipses, syzygy, and aniversaries are all potent times due temporal contagion,
	      in order to increase the power of specific spells.
	      Similarly, various times of the year are more auspicious for the casting
	      certain rituals because of the contagion with the castings of the
	      spell at the same time of in prior years, <eg/> the solstices.  The GM
	      should feel free to apply modifiers to casting as they see fit at such times.
	    </p>
	  </subsubsubsection>

	  
	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Proximal Contagion</subsubsubsectiontitle>
	    <p>
      	      Things that are close to one another are linked by proximal contagion.
      	      This is why many spells have a range.  Beyond that range it becomes
      	      difficult to form a decent conduit.  Magic at great distance is very difficult.
	      If something has been close to the subject of a spell for a long time then
	      that item might make a good spell component.
	    </p>
	  </subsubsubsection>

	  <subsubsubsection>
	    <subsubsubsectiontitle>Portals</subsubsubsectiontitle>
	    <p>
      	      Portals are ethereal pathways between or within planes that allow travel
      	      or projection through those portals.   A portal, once established, allows the caster
      	      to overcome many of the barriers of proximal contagion.  Portals are geographically
	      distributed points bound by powerful contagious energies.  
      	      There are two types of porta, those that are known as Greater Portals, True Portals or
      	      simply just Portals, through which corporeal travel is possible, and Lesser Portals,
      	      sometimes called conduits, which are purely magical conduits through which spells may
	      be cast. Opening a portal of any size is such a difficult and dangerous practice that
	      it usually requires assistance at the destination.
	    </p>

	    <p>
      	      Greater portals require huge amounts of thaumaturgical energy to create and to keep
      	      open.  Once open they allow beings to physically pass from one plane to another.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	      Lesser portals are used for communication.  Devils and demons may create a simulacrum
	      of themselves through a lesser portal.
      	      Their facsimile is created by congealling ectoplasm from the environment.
      	      When the lesser portal is shut this breaks any link through the portal.  However,
      	      the simulacrum remains linked with their parent by contagion for some time afterwards.
      	      Possession is also made possible by lesser portals.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
      	      Opening portals is extremely dangerous as their are countless beings lying
      	      in wait, in a manner not to disimilar to the way the monstrous glowing demon fish
	      hungrily await their hapless prey in the cold and the dark of the deep oceans.

	  <subsubsectiontitle>The Law of Knowledge</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    Thaumaturgical fluxes bind all things.  The better a caster understands a subject,
	    the better he understands the contagious influences that effect that subject, and
	    the easier it is for the magic user to cast spells that effect the subject.
	    The greater the knowledge the magical practitioner has about his subject the more
	    power they have over that subject <indexentry>Rules of Magic<subentry>Third</subentry>
	    </indexentry>, knowledge is power.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The GM, at their discretion, should apply modifiers to the DC if the caster can
	    demonstrate deep or special knowledge about the subject.  Similarly, having an accurate
	    physical or mental model or representation of the target of a spell may grant an
	    additional modifier.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <indexentry>True Name</indexentry>
	    Over time and with repetition the name of a being forms a contagious conduit with the
	    being.  The names of truely ancient or powerful beings are spoken many many times and
	    their name comes to hold significant power over them.  Knowing the True Name of a magical
	    being grants an additional modifiers to the spell, at the GMs discretion and proportional
	    to the beings age and power.  It is for this reason that many of these beings shroud
	    themselves in the shadows of anonymity, and why many great casters seek solitude.  This
	    is why it pleases the creatures of the night to be known by many names.  It is also why
	    clerics invoke the names of their deities when casting.  The True Name of a creature is
	    a Word of Power bound to that creature.

	<subsectiontitle>Other Rules</subsectiontitle>

	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Assisting a Cast</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    It is possible to cast spells cooperatively.  In order to do so the caster and one or
	    more assistants simultaneously perform a Shared Dice Pool Check.  The result is the sum
	    of all the dice rolled.  In order to assist a conduit must exist between any assistants and
	    the caster, for example via physical contact, or some other magically conductive path (e.g.
	    a staff).  Only the caster may ground out any magic.  Any assistants exhaust
	    dice on a 3 or less, by default, as the conduit from assistant to caster is leaky.  In the
	    event of an overcharge, any assisting casters will also be effected by the overcharge
	    unless they make a Speed DC 14 Check to break the conduit with the caster.
	  </p>    
	</subsubsection>

	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Rituals</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    <indexentry>Magic<subentry>Ritual Casting</subentry></indexentry>
	    <indexentry>Ritual Casting</indexentry>      
	    Rituals are spells cast cooperatively over a long period of time.  A ritual is cast by
	    one or more participants over a period of hours.  There is always one leader of the spell
	    who controls the magic.  The participants in a ritual must be casters or blood magic
	    practioners.  Every hour each participant contributes one die towards a shared pool, one
	    die per hour.  For every hour after the first the participants must
	    make a Willpower DC 9 check.  If they fail they lose concentration and can no longer contribute
	    magic to the ritual though they cannot break the circle.  Every participant who has can cast 
	    the ritual spell must add their spell rank to the result.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Only the ritual leader may exhaust dice or use items during a spell.  Ritual magic may
	    also gain a modifiers from the use of effigies, prepared casting circle, items linking them
	    to the destination by contagion etc.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Ritual casting is a special rule for certain spells tagged <emph>Ritual</emph>.  Spells are
	    usually cast <emph>Extemporaneously</emph>.  If a spell is not tagged as a ritual then it is
	    assumed to be cast extemporaneously.  Some spells can be cast either as a ritual or extemporaneously.

	</subsubsection>

	
	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Influence, Possession and Domination</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    Magic items embued with essence of other beings may come to exert pressure on
	    the bearer of the item.  There are three levels of control a magic item may have
	    over a PC: influence, possession, and domination.  Influence are purely story
	    based effects.  The character has dreams or nightmares and feels the urge to do certain
	    things or is drawn to certain people or locations.   Possession is represented
	    in game by the character gaining a new Aspect to reflect the control of the item
	    over the character.  If the character is dominated then the GM takes the characters
	    sheet and runs the character, usually for a short period of time. The character may
	    or may not be allowed a will-power save against these effects, depending on the item.
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>


	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Interaction of Magical Items</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    Controlling magic during the casting of spells is a difficult process
	    at the best of times.  Doing so with multiple casting aids is nearly impossible.
	    For example, a caster should not use a wand and a rod in the same casting, or
	    a wand and a staff.  The caster may carry and even hold multiple
	    items but using more than one at a time is very difficult.  Woe betide the fool
	    who attempts to make play things of such dark and potent energies.  
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>


	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Holy Symbols <indexentry>Holy Symbols</indexentry></subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    <label>sec:holy-symbol</label>
	    Holy symbols use contagion to increase the strength of the conduit between a
	    theurgical caster and their sponsor.  It is assumed that theurgical casters have a
	    magical symbol.  If a theurgical caster is not using a holy symbol they suffer a
	    -2 DC Modifier.  This is reduced to a -1 DC Modifier if the caster has time to
	    improvise a holy symbol.
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>

	
	
	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Staves, Spears and Groundig</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    <indexentry>Grounding - Staffs/Spears</indexentry>
	    Because Staves and Spears are constructed from wood, a magically conductive material, they can be
	    used to ground out spells, to mitigate the effects of overcharging.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    After a spell has overcharged the caster may be able to <emph>ground</emph> out some extra
	    overcharge energy.  This involves disipating some of the magical energy by creating a conduit for
	    magic to flow into the earth.  Grounding
	    allows the caster to exhaust any single die from the check before the results of the check are
	    finalized. <indexentry>Grounding</indexentry> 
	    <indexentry>Spell Casting<subentry>Grounding</subentry></indexentry>.      
	  </p>    

	  <p>
	    The process of grounding requires a well controlled magical flux.  This flux is highly sensitive
	    to metal.  Metal adversely effects the flow of magic and casters wearing armour have difficulty grounding
	    dice with as much finnesse as they might otherwise be able to.   A character is only able
	    to ground dice with face values greater than or equal to the sum of their grounding modifiers, see 
	    Table<ref>figure:{{ doc_name }}-magic-modifiers</ref>.  For example a mage with a staff and no armour
	    may ground a die with any face value, <ie/> with a face value greater than zero, a mage wearing
	    heavy metal armour, <eg/> chain mail, and using a spear can only ground out dice with a face value of
	    six.

	    energy.  Magical rods can be used in combat and are equivalent to a club.  Once used
	    the caster needs to recharge the rod which they may do when they rest as if it were
	    their own pool.  The die used for the rod in a spell check should be rolled separatly
	    from the casters pool or be of a different colour (the dice in these pools exhaust independently).

	    to characters when they attune with the item.  The nature of the interaction
	    required to transfer the items aspects to the character depends on the item,
	    <eg/> the aspects might be applied when they touch the item, or when they have used

	<indexentry>Groups<subentry>Combat</subentry></indexentry>     
	Combat is a core part of the game and has its own specific set of rules.
	Before combat starts all the combatants	are divided into groups by the GM,
	typically there will be be one group of PCs, and one to three groups of
	monsters/NPCs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <indexentry>Initiative Order</indexentry>
        <indexentry>Group Order</indexentry>
	Malleus Deum uses <defn>Group Order</defn> to determine the order in which
	these Groups act during combat.  When a Group acts, every member of the group
	takes a turn.	Members of the group may take their turns in any order within
	their group. So when the PC's group acts, the players may choose the order in
	which their characters act, within their group, or just take their turns in
	clockwise order	around the table.  Once all members of a group have taken their
	turn, the next group in order acts.
      </p>
      
      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Determining Group Order Before Combat</subsectiontitle>		
	<p>
	  In mundane combat encounters the <emph>GM should just choose the Group Order</emph>.
	  If the monsters start the fight then perhaps they should have initiative.  Otherwise
	  the GM should consider just allowing the PCs to go first, they are supposed to be
	  the heroes after all.  This makes combat faster, keeps the game moving and gives
	  the PCs agency.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the GM wishes one of a number of different checks may be used before combat to
	  determine group order.  These checks are: <emph>Initiative</emph>,
	  <emph>Surprise</emph>, and <emph>Ambush</emph>.  
	</p>

	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Initiative</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    The GM should consider getting the players to make an initiative check in any of the following
	    circumstances:
	    <list>
	      <li>The narrative dictates, <eg/> when confronting "boss" monsters, or</li>
	      <li>When the stakes are high, when inititiative order might be strategically important
	      to the outome of the combat, or</li>
	      <li>To punish the PCs for poor strategic decisions, or </li>
	      <li>To punish the PCs for bad luck when executing their plans.</li>
	    </list>
	  </p>

	  <p>	    
            <indexentry>Initiative Check</indexentry>
	    <emph>Initiative is an Opposed Group Delegate check.  One member of each group is chosen
	    by the GM to roll an ability check to determine their groups Initiative Result.  During
	    combat the groups act in order from highest initiative result to lowest.</emph>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    An <defn>Initiative Check</defn> is made using an ability chosen by the GM,
	    and based on context.  Some abilities that could be used to make the initiative check
	    are ✱✱primary.perception, ✱✱primary.speed, Listen, and Scout.  We use
	    the term <defn>Initiative Check</defn> to refer to this check irrespective of what
	    underlying ability was used to make the check.  Different groups may use different
	    abilities for an Initiative Check. 
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>


	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Surprise</subsubsectiontitle>	  
	  <p>
	    <label>sec:surprise</label>
            <indexentry>Surprise</indexentry>
	    Under certain circumstances it is possible for one group to surprise another group.
	    For this to happen two conditions must be satisfied:
	    <olist>
	      <li>The GM rules that Surprise is possible, and</li>
	      <li>One group must succeed at a Surprise Check</li>
	    </olist>
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The GM should rule that <emph>surprise is possible</emph> when the situation and narrative
	    allow it.  For example it may be impossible for one group to surprise another on barren plains
	    where there is no cover for miles around, or when two groups approach each other down a light
	    corridor.  The GM should ensure that it is very hard to surprise groups expecting to be
	    attacked.
	  </p>	    

	  <p>
	    A <defn>Surprise Check</defn> is a Group Delegate Check where one
	    character from the surprising group checks their Stealth Result versus one of their
	    opponents Perception or Listen Check Result.
	  </p>	  

	  <p>
	    <emph>When a group is surprised it gets no actions for the first round of combat.  In
	    addition the surprised group must make a Mettle Check.  The attackers gain advantage
	    on any Std Checks during a Surprise Roll.  Additionally, whether the surprise attempt is
	    successful or not the would be surpriser automatically wins initiative.</emph>
	  </p>	  
	  
	  <playexample>
            <p>
              Dourli, attempts to surprise two gang members in the city by attacking them from behind
	      under the cover of darkness.  Dourli is aware of his opponents already, but do the
	      gang members become aware of Dourli?  Dourli makes a Stealth check against his opponents
	      Perception DC.  If successful his opponents will be unaware of him and he will surprise
	      the gang members, if he fails to surprise them he probably should still go first in
	      the initiative, since he is a player character and he initiated the attack.
            </p>

	  <subsubsectiontitle>Ambush</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
            <indexentry>Ambush</indexentry>
	    Ambush is special subtype of Surprise that occurs when the ambusher has enough
	    time to plan their initial attack well.  For a successful ambush one group must be
	    be stationary waiting in ambush.  The other group must move into the ambush area.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <emph>Players receive a +6 modifier to their surprise when ambushing, and they receive
	    a -6 modifier to their surprise roll when being ambushed.   The effects of being
	    ambushed are the same as those for being surprised.  In addition, the ambushers may
	    have had time to set traps and snares, prepare actions, cast non-combat spells
	    <etc/> at the GMs discretion.</emph>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Standard Action</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  Standard actions are the main combat actions that are used for most
	  physical attacks and many spells.  Examples are Sword Strike and Axe Strike.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Move Action</subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  During combat there are a number of different movement actions available.
	  A normal <defn>Move Action</defn> allows the character to move their normal move distance.
	  A <defn>Run Action</defn> is performing two Move Actions in a Round, <eg/>
	  the character Moves and then demotes their Standard Action to another Move Action, moving
	  twice.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The character may <defn>Flee</defn> which is a Run Action away from danger.  Fleeing
	  characters gain an extra d6 movement, but must make a Morale Check to stop fleeing.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Characters may also make a <defn>Charge</defn> Action.  In order to make a charge
	  a character has to be greater than their movement away from the target of their
	  charge.  First the charging character moves their movement towards their opponent.
	  Then the Charging character must make a Mettle Check.  If they fail, they make an
	  additional move towards their opponent but do not attack.   If they succeed they move
	  an additional movement, with a +d6 bonus movement, and may then perform a melee attack.
	</p>

	<p>
	  On a grid, the distance the character may move a number of squares up to the movement value
	  on their character sheet.  Using TOTM the GM will dictate distances to the players.
	</p>
      </subsection>
      

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Minor Action</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  A minor action is any operation that can be performed in very short period of time,
	  <eg/> grabbing an item from your belt, opening a door, picking an item up
	  <etc/>.
	</p>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Free Actions</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
      	  A <defn>Free Action</defn> is an optional extra action that the character performs
	  in his turn and that does not count against their limit of actions for their round.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Immediate Actions</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  <defn>Immediate Actions</defn> are Free Actions that the characters can perform
	  once, <emph>at any time</emph> during the round.  Examples of Immediate Actions
	  are using Leadership to try and cause a halt to combat to allow negotiation,
	  and Fleeing.
	</p>
      </subsection>


      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Multi-Turn Actions</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
          <indexentry>Full Turn Action</indexentry>
          <indexentry>Multi Turn Action</indexentry>
	  Some tasks require longer than a standard action to perform, typically either one
	  or more whole turns.  We call these full-turn or multi-turn actions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  A <defn>Full Turn Action</defn> takes a whole turn to complete.  That is one standard
	  action, one move action and one minor action.  These actions can be performed in any
	  order and they can be started in one turn and finished in another.  <defn>Multi Turn
	  Actions</defn> require some number of full turn actions.  For example, a Two-Turn Action
	  requires two standard actions, two move actions and two minor actions to complete.
	</p>

	<p>
          <indexentry>Collective Action</indexentry>
	  Collective actions allow multiple characters to contribute actions towards a goal.
	  In these cases all characters that contribute must have the appropriate ability.
	  The character that contributes the last required action rolls for the check.
	  Collective actions should have the <defn>collective</defn> tag.
	</p>

	<p>
          <indexentry>Interuptable Action</indexentry>
	  Long Actions may or may not be <defn>interuptable</defn>.  If an action is <emph>interuptable</emph>
	  characters can perform some part of the action, then do something else, and the return
	  to the action and continue performing the action without losing previous progress.
	  If an action is <emph>not interuptable</emph> then any interuption will cause the
	  action to fail and any progress will be lost.   Multi-turn actions should be assume
	  <emph>not</emph> to be interruptable unless otherwise stated.
	</p>
      </subsection>


      
      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Reactions</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  <indexentry>Reactions</indexentry>
	  Under certain circumstances a character will be able to perform an additional
	  <defn>Reaction</defn> during someone else's action or when a special triggering
	  event occurs.

	  Reactions are actions that the GM deems may be performed as a Reaction in a given
	  context, or any abilities specially labelled as such, <eg/> Shield Block,
	  Sword Parry, Cloak Fighting and Dodge.  A character may perform at
	  most one reaction per round.  If two or more characters want to react to an action the
	  GM decides the reaction order, possibly using an opposed Speed check.

	  Miscellaneous actions refer to things that characters do during combat
	  for which no explicit rules exist, <eg/> reading the runes that close
	  a magic portal, releasing a portcullis, mounting a horse, quaffing a potion,
	  pushing a load of barrels over and so on.
	</p>

	<p>
	  For many miscellaneous actions the GM will just have to make a ruling as
	  to the check required and the type of action; standard, move or minor: as 
	  it would infeasible for us to provide rules for the myriad of
	  miscellaneous actions that might occur.  We suggest that the GM rule that
	  these are minor actions if they can as it encourages strategic thinking and
	  more variety during combat.  You could estimate the time required and work
	  out the actions required as follows.. whole turn is 10 seconds, a standard action
	  is six seconds, a move action is three seconds, and a minor action is one second.
	  Then, if an action will take thirty seconds to perform it will need three whole
	  rounds to complete.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Prepared Actions</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  If the character knows that a combat is imminent they may declare that they
	  prepare an action.  At that point, at the GMs discretion, the action gains
	  a +3 check modifier, <eg/> a prepared arrow shot triggered when someone enters a room
	  would gain a +3 bonus to succeed.

          <indexentry>Combat<subentry>Boons</subentry></indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Combat<subentry>Banes</subentry></indexentry> 
	  Since combat is such a major part of the game the characters will be rolling
	  Boons and Banes quite often.  The standard Boon for martial abilities
	  is double damage.  The standard Bane for martial abilities is half damage.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Some suggested boons and banes for use during combat checks
	  can be found in Tables <ref>table:{{ doc_name }}-to-hit-boons-and-banes</ref>

      <playexample>
	<p>
	  The thugs have returned to the cellars.  Dourli and Roslyn have been unable to 
	  escape and now a fight looks inevitable.  It's still dark and our heroes have 
	  managed to hide from the thugs so far.  Dourli attacks the thugs from his 
	  hidden position attempting to ambush them.  The GM notes that the Thugs will
	  be expecting trouble, they are Alert, and so decides the bonus to ambush the
	  thugs is reduced to +3.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Dourli tries to get advantage from the <emph>dark</emph> tag of the cellars and
	  prepares an attack.   The GM agrees and gives the adventurers a <emph>+1</emph>
	  arguing that the fact that the thugs were expecting to find Dourli down here would
	  somewhat negate that advantage. Dourli agrees.
	</p>

	<p>
	  As this is a group delegate check the GM chooses Roslyn to check her Stealth versus
	  the thugs Perception DC.  If Roslyn succeeds then the Thugs are ambushed, Roslyn
	  and Dourli win initiative and get a free round of attacks, the first attack
	  from Dourli gains a bonus to succeed as a prepared action and the thugs must
	  make a morale check.
	</p>
      </playexample>        

      <playexample>
	<p>
	  Dourli and his ally Roslyn, have been cornered by the local gang leader Fenton 
	  One-Eye and two of his thugs.  A fight in the cellar of the Inn has been 
	  underway for some number of rounds.  During the fight a few kegs of whisky 
	  have been smashed and there is a shallow pool of whisky on the ground.  
	</p>

	<p>
	  One of the thugs attacks Dourli with an Axe Strike I.  Dourli defends with a
	  Shield Block 3, since he has rank 3 so he rolls 2D12 with a +3 bonus to his
	  block, the attack has a DC of 13 + 1 for the Axe Strike rank.  He needs an
	  11 or more on his roll to succeed.  He roll double fours.  That is a failure
	  and also a boon.  The GM declares that Dourli takes half damage which for an axe
	  is 3 hit points.  That has used Dourlis one reaction for the round.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The second thug tries to stab Dourli with his dagger.  Dourli has no reactions
	  left so he has to defend with an Armour save.

          <indexentry>TOTM (Theatre of the the mind)</indexentry> 	  
	  Combat may either be performed on a table with miniatures using a map with a
	  <defn>Grid</defn>, or purely narratively using the <defn>Theatre of the Mind</defn>, <aka/>
	  <defn>TOTM</defn>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the combat takes place on a grid then the map determines 
	  the distances for movement, spell area of effect, missile weapon range etc. 
	  On a map a run is simply a double movement, a charge is a movement + d6 extra 
	  squares then an attack if the enemy is in range.  Fleeing characters move twice 
	  their movement rate +d6 extra squares.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Movement is halved over <defn>difficult terrain</defn>. 
	  Difficult terrain includes: muddy ground, rocky ground, and generally any terrain
	  with a lot of debris, brambles etc.
	</p>        

	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Range</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    <indexentry>Range</indexentry>
	    Missile weapons and some spells are ranged actions.  Up to that range the action
	    is made without any modifiers.  If the attack occurs at a distance greater than the
	    range and less than or equal to twice the range then that attack suffers a -3
	    <defn>Long Range</defn>  modifier.  Beyond twice their range the action cannot be
	    taken effectively and will automatically fail.

	    Cover provides modifiers to checks for most missile weapons and for melee combat.
	    <defn>Light Cover</defn> afforded by bushes and the like 
	    gives a -3 check modifier, <defn>Hard Cover</defn>, such as a half wall, 
	    provides a -6 check modifier.  
	    <defn>Full Cover</defn> makes hitting the target impossible.  The GM should feel

	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Zones of Control</subsubsectiontitle>

	  <p>
	    When playing with TOTM the GM determines whether attacks of opportunity occur.
	    When playing on a grid we need a more precise definition.  We define a
	    <defn>Zone of Control</defn> as the one square perimeter around the character,
	    See Figure<ref>figure:zones</ref>.  The Ogre A is in character X's zone of control,
	    Ogre B is not.

	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Attacks of Opportunity</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    If characters or monsters move past opponents during combat they may
	    grant an attack of opportunity which is a standard action made as a reaction
	    to the movement.  Disengaging from combat and moving away from combat does
	    <emph>not</emph> grant an attack of opportunity.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>	
	    A character grants an <defn>Attack of Opportunity</defn> every time the they move
	    from one cell in an opponents zone of control into another cell in any opponents zone of
	    control.  The attack of opportunity is granted to the opponent whose cell the
	    character moves to.  Do not forget the limit of at most one reaction per
	    character per Turn.  In Figure<ref>figure:opportunity_attack_simple</ref>, monster A gives
	    attacks of opportunity whenever he moves along the arrows in the diagram.

	    <indexentry>Reach</indexentry>
	    Reach weapons are melee weapons with a longer range than most, for example spears are reach weapons.
	    Weapons with reach have the advantage that they grant an Opportunity Attack when an opponent moves into
	    a characters zone of control.  For example, in Figure<ref>figure:reach_weapons</ref>, Ogre A gives
	    an attack of opportunity to Character P whenever he moves along the arrows in the diagram <emph>if character

	  <subsubsectiontitle>Flanking <label>sec:flanking</label></subsubsectiontitle>

	  <p>
	    When playing using theatre of the mind, whether or not a character is flanked
	    is determined by role-playing and GM fiat, <eg/> the GM might require the character
	    makes a check to leap over a table to get into a flanking position.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    When playing on a grid a character is said to be <defn>Flanked</defn> if he is
	    being attacked by two or more opponents from an angle of greater than 90° degrees.
	    Attacks on flanked characters gain a +3 check modifier, see

	    have at least as many people in it as the back row.  To make melee
	    attacks from the back row you must be using a weapon with reach.
	    It is possible for a group to have two front rows, <ie/> to be fighting
	    on two fronts, provided that the number of people in each front row
	    is greater than or equal to the number of people in the back row.
	    Furthermore, characters in the back row add a temporary bonus die to

	Non-Lethal Combat <label>sec:non-lethal-combat</label>
	<indexentry>Combat<subentry>Non-Lethal Combat</subentry></indexentry> 	
      </sectiontitle>
      
      <p>
	There are two categories of combat: Lethal and Non-Lethal.  In Non-Lethal 
	combat the participants are not actively trying to kill their opponents, but 
	rather trying to subdue them or drive them off.  
      </p>

      <p>
	There is no difference between Lethal and Non-Lethal combat until an opponents
	stamina reaches zero and someone becomes <defn>Bloodied</defn>.  
	At that point a decision has to be made as to whether the combat is lethal or
	non-lethal.  If the combat is non-lethal then the bloodied
	opponent has to willingly withdraw from the combat or make a morale check to
	convert the combat to a Lethal Combat.  So it is possibly for a non-lethal combat
	to become lethal at some point during the combat.  Ultimately the GM decides what
	type of combat is occurring, but as a guide combat between civilized humanoids,
	particularly in	places with established legal systems and prohibitions against
	violence, will be assumed to be non-lethal, at least initially.  Combat against
	monsters and uncivilized humanoids should be considered to be lethal be default.
      </p>

      <p>
	There is a case where, during a non-lethal combat, a character may have 
	lost most of their stamina,  and are then hit with a big hit and lose all their
	remaining health.  In such a case the normal rules for reduction of health to zero
	apply.  This will probably result in either the combat becoming lethal, or the
	opponents running away.  Weapons tagged non-lethal reduce the opponents health to
	one in this case.
      </p>

      <p>      
	Examples of typical non-lethal combat encounters include fights with the local 
	guards, bar-room brawls, fights with gangs of thugs and bandits.  There are 
	many reasons to use non-lethal combat: killing people is often a capital crime 
	in human society, there are severe social implications when an individual 
	becomes known as a killer, potentially the players might wish to interrogate 
	an opponent, and bandits might want to make money selling people into slavery.

	Characters may heal by taking a long or a short rest.  A <defn>Short Rest</defn> is
	a ten minute or more length of time that the characters perform no strenuous activity.
	At the end of a short rest the characters regain all their Stamina 
	and may refresh one dice pool at their dice pool refresh rate.
      </p>

      <p>
	A <defn>Long Rest</defn> is a six hour or more length of time that the characters
	sleep.  At the end of a long rest the characters regain all their Stamina, regain
	Health at their Health Heal rate, and refresh dice into their dice pools at twice
	their dice pool refresh rate.   Previously unused short rests can be taken at the
	same time as a long rest.

  <chapter>
    <chaptertitle>Abilities<label>ch:abilities</label></chaptertitle>

    <p>
      This chapter describes abilities available to characters in the game.
      <indexentry>Abilities</indexentry>
      Each character has a set of <defn>Abilities</defn>.
      Abilities may be used in a variety of ways depending on the ability in question.
      Some abilities allow the player to perform <defn>Actions</defn> or
      <defn>Ability Checks</defn> while others provide the player with passive advantages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Abilities are tags and like other tags, they may be used by the player
      to gain an advantage in an appropriate context.
    </p>

    <p>
      Abilities have ranks.  Some abilities start with an <defn>untrained rank</defn>, often
      0 or -3.  Abilities that have an untraind rank can be attempted without training by any
      character.  All characters automatically have all untrained abilities but we do not usually
      bother to write these down on the character sheet until they reach rank one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <indexentry>Mastering an Ability</indexentry>
      <indexentry>Ability<subentry>Mastery</subentry></indexentry>
      You cannot learn an ability unless you have satisfied the prerequisites for that ability.
      One prerequisite for gaining ability ranks
      is mastery of the previous rank of the ability.  That is, in order to gain rank 2
      of an ability, rank 1 must first be mastered.  In order to master the ability the
      player must have successfully used the ability before.  All untrained abilities
      are considered to be automatically mastered already as untrained means the character
      has no experience in the ability. The first time an unmastered ability is used the
      character should mark off the success on their character sheet.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the character goes up a level they gain promotions in certain classes of abilities
      up to certain ranks.  For example a character might gain the following promotions:
      Martial<leqqsymbol/>3, Hammer<leqqsymbol/>4, Transport or Craft<leqqsymbol/>6.  What
      this means is that the character can raise the rank of any one ability from the Martial
      section up to a maximum rank of 3 provided that they have satisfied all of that
      ability ranks prerequisites.  The only time prerequisite requirements are waivered is
      when the text states that the character gains an ability at a given rank.
    </p>

    <p>
      All abilities have a type.  The type of the ability is mainly used to determine when
      and if an ability can be used during combat.  All abilities have one of the following
      types: reaction, standard, minor, move, immediate, non-combat, tag.  We discuss ability
      types further in the section on combat.
    </p>

      <indexentry>Skill<subentry>Passive</subentry></indexentry>
      <indexentry>Skill<subentry>Default Difficulty</subentry></indexentry>
      All abilities have a Default Difficulty, DDC.  This is a completely non-binding
      suggestion to the GM for the difficulty that might be used for checks associated with
      this skill.  Abilities with a DDC of 0 are passive.  This means that the the effects of
      the ability always apply, and that their is no way to successfully make checks with
      this ability.  It follows that there is no way to promote such abilities.  Most DDC 0
      abilities are reserved for monsters.
