      Artillery is assumed to be constructed from brass.  Brass is stronger, longer-lasting, and two to three times
      more expensive than iron artillery.  Brass also fails less frequently and less dangerously than iron.  Historically,
      brass guns predate iron by hundreds of years.

      <description>	
	<p>
	  Blackpowder is a mixture of the following compounds: Nitre, Brimstone and Charcoal.
	  Nitre is produced in a Nitrary where urine is mixed with straw and evaporated in large
	  covered pools.  Nitre takes six months to produce and is usually done on a large scale.
	  Brimstone can be obtained from volcanoes or by heating sulphurous rocks
	  in a kiln. Charcoal is wood burned in stacks underground over a period of days.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A keg of blackpowder is enough to do some serious structural damage to most buildings
	  walls or bridges (not city walls or donjons and other structures designed to
	  resist this kind of damage).  A keg of black powder is also enough to supply a
	  pistoler effectively indefinitely.

	  Grenades are thin-walled iron containers filled with black-powder and lit
	  with a slow fuse.  Each turn after being thrown the grenade makes a Std Check
	  vs 7 or goes off.  When the grenades goes off a character in the same square
	  receives 2d6 damage, each character adjacent recieves d6 points damage, and
	  characters within two squares receive d3 damage.  A grenade may be placed or
	  thrown using a successful Throw check.

	  A Petard is a small bomb used for blowing up gates and walls when breaching
	  fortifications.  A typical petard is a conical metal device containing
	  <measurement><metric>2kg</metric><imperial>5 pounds</imperial></measurement> of
	  blackpowder, with a slow match for a fuse. At the end of the turn the Petard is
	  placed the petardier makes a Std Check vs 7 or it goes off.  Make a Std Check for
	  any adjacent doors with a difficulty of 5 (reinforced doors, <eg/> in
	  fortifications will have a higher difficulty).  If the door fails it is destroyed.

	<p>
	  Caltrops are metal spikes they can be shaped like a tetrahedron and
	  thrown upon the ground or more like a double ended nail and driven
	  into the earth.  Characters who know that the area is sown with caltrops
	  can move through a square with caltrops at half speed without risk.
	  Characters who do not know that a square is sown with caltops must make
	  a Std Check with a difficulty equal to the number of caltrops in the
	  square plus one (up to a maxium of 10 caltrops).  Horses never
	  know that a square is sown with caltrops.
	</p>

	<p>
	  When a character stands on a caltrop they suffer 1d3 damage and must
	  make a Mettle check for each additional square of movement they make
	  before removing the caltrop (an action).  When a horse stands on a caltrop
	  a rider must make a difficult horse-riding or animal handling check or
	  the horse panics or falls (50% chance for each).  If the horse falls the
	  rider takes d6 damage and is knocked prone.

	<p>
	  War Fire is a highly flammable, self-igniting, liquid made from
	  Pine Resin, Naptha, and Quicklime.  Pine resin is the harvested sap
	  from pine trees.  Naptha is made from light oils.  Quicklime is made
	  by heating sea shells.  The final mixture must be kept very dry.  It
	  is typically stored in sealed ceramic jars.  When the jars are broken
	  the contents ignite.  War Fire can be thrown using a Throw check.
	  When they land they thrower makes a Std Check vs 4 and if successful
	  the jar breaks and ignites.  Any character in the target square suffers
	  d6 damage each round until the fire is extinguished, and gains the
	  Burning condition (they must make a Mettle check to ignore the fire).
	  If they attempt to put out the fire they make a Std Check vs DC 10.

      <subsubsectiontitle>Crossbows</subsubsectiontitle>
      <p>
	For game purposes we distinguish between light and heavy 
	crossbows.  Light crossbows are loaded in one motion
	by manually pulling back the string or with a goats foot lever,
	while heavy crossbows require a windlass or cranequin to winch
	the string back.

      <subsubsectiontitle>Bows</subsubsectiontitle>
      <p>
	We distinguish between two types of bows: short bows and long bows.
	Short bows are about <measurement><metric>one meter</metric>
	<imperial>three feet</imperial></measurement>
	long and can be shot from horseback.  Long bows are about
	<measurement><metric>two meters</metric><imperial>six feet</imperial></measurement>
	long, require
	significant upper body strength to use, and must be used from a standing position.
	A long bow cannot be used by archetypes with the <emph>Short</emph> tag.

    <subsubsection>
      <subsubsectiontitle>Firearms</subsubsectiontitle>
      <p>
	There are two different types of firearms used in the game: Pistols and Arquebuses.
	Pistols are single handed and weapons and Arquebuses are a primitive long barrelled
	firearm.  Both of these weapons are smooth bore, muzzle loaded, black powder weapons
	and are very slow to load.

    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection>
      <subsubsectiontitle>Mace, Morning Star</subsubsectiontitle>
      <p>
	A mace is a club-like weapon that has specifically been constructed
	as a weapon.  For the purposes of this game, though perhaps historically inaccurately,
	maces are wooden clubs with metal spikes or bands for extra weight and hardness
	(clubs are all wooden and are improvised or very cheap).  Maces are heavy crushing
	weapons that work well against heavily armoured foes.   Morning Stars are all metal
	are more expensive and a little less likely to break.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection>
      <subsubsectiontitle>Flail</subsubsectiontitle>
      <p>
	A flail is a heavy crushing weapon which has a number of metal balls
	attached by a chain to a haft.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection>
      <subsubsectiontitle>Club</subsubsectiontitle>
      <p>	
	Clubs are single handed, weapons constructd from heavy pieces of wood.
	easily improvised from wood lying about.  If a club is constructed with
	metal bands, spikes or even just nails then it qualifies as a Mace.

    <p>
      One of the possible outcomes when a boon or a bane is rolled is that a Break Save must be made
      for a piece of equipment.  This might occur when any of the following happens:
      <list>
        <li>When the player attacks with a boon roll a save for the opponents weapon or armour.</li>
        <li>When the player defends using armour with a bane roll a save for their armour.</li>
        <li>When a player defends using parry with a bane roll a save for their weapon.</li>
        <li>When a player defends using block with a bane roll a save for their shield.</li>
      </list>      
      To make a Break Save make a Std Check against the Save DC for the weapon or armour.
      The values for the Save DCs for standard weapons are presented in the equipment tables
      alongside their prices.  If the weapon save fails the weapon or armour is broken.
      Broken armour has a reduced Armour Bonus until it is repaired.  Broken weapons might
      have reduced damage or be completely useless at the GMs discretion.

    <subsectiontitle>Weapon and Armour Quality (Optional)</subsectiontitle>

    <p>
      We distinguish five levels of weapon and armour quality: Masterwork, Good Quality,
      Average Quality, Poor Quality, and Shoddy Quality.  In practice the item quality
      manifests itself in three ways.  Firstly, the quality of the weapons and armour are
      obvious to observers. So having high quality weapons and items is likely to impress
      and intimidate people.  Secondly, price.  The cost of higher quality items is much
      greater than the cost of average quality items.  Finally, item quality affects
      the items save DC.  The prices and saves of items in the weapons and armour
      tables above are for average quality items.  Finally note that the prices of these
      goods varies from place to place and time to time.

        <indexentry>Masterwork Weapons/Armour</indexentry>
        <indexentry>Weapon Quality<subentry>Masterwork</subentry></indexentry>
	Masterwork items have been made by a very experienced artisan out of the
	finest materials.  Often they will be ornately decorated metal filligree,
	or inlaid with semi-precious stones such as lapis lazuli, or ivory and
	the like.  The cost of masterwork items is typically from four to ten times
	the listed price of the items in the tables above.  The Save DC for these
	items reduced by two.
      </description>

      <term>Good Quality</term>
      <description>
        <indexentry>Good Quality Weapons/Armour</indexentry>	
	<indexentry>Weapon Quality<subentry>Good</subentry></indexentry>
	Good quality items are made by competent or better craftsmen out of
	decent materials.  The cost of these items is twice the listed price
	in the tables above and the items Save DC is reduced by one.
      </description>
      
      <term>Average</term>
      <description>
        <indexentry>Average Quality Weapons/Armour</indexentry>
        <indexentry>Weapon Quality<subentry></subentry></indexentry>
	Average quality items are the default.  They are created, often en masse,
	by work-a-day craftsmen.  
      </description>
      
      <term>Poor</term>
      <description>
        <indexentry>Poor Quality Weapons/Armour</indexentry>	
        <indexentry>Weapon Quality<subentry>Poor</subentry></indexentry>
	Poor quality items either old, poorly constructed or created from poorly
	smelted metals.  These items cost about half price to buy and sell for the
	price of the metals used in their construction.  Poor quality wooden weapons
	have virtually no resale value.  These items have their Save DC increased by
	three. 
      </description>
      
      <term>Shoddy</term>
      <description>
        <indexentry>Shoddy Quality Weapons/Armour</indexentry>	
        <indexentry>Weapon Quality<subentry>Shoddy</subentry></indexentry>
	Shoddy items are of terrible quality.  Like Poor Quality items they
	have little resale value.  The items Save DC is increased by six.
