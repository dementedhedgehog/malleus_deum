          An Ansible of the Gates is a small obsidian box, perhaps the size of a
          matchbox, inlaid with golden sigils such as a circle and pentagram.  The
          box feels hollow but there does not appear to be any means to open it.
        </p>

        <p>
          These boxes are used to entrap and contain demons.  If opened the demon
          within will escape and attack those around it.  If the box is put to the
          ear the demon will be able to whisper to the listener and may have
          conversations with them.  The demon will initially lie about the nature
          of the box and attempt to win them over.  Helping them in whatever way it
          can.  Its goal at this stage will be to attempt to get the listener to
          put the box somewhere where it will be badly damaged, realeasing the demon.
          If found out the demon will attempt to intimidate the listener.  If that fails
          they will attempt to bargain with them, trading knowledge for their freedom.
          Finally, if all else fails the demon might resort to begging the listener for
          their freedom.

          A potion that places the taker in a state of sleep that makes them seem
          like they are dead for half an hour.  It will be extremely difficult to
          tell through non-magical means that the embiber is not actually dead
          (they are just mostly dead and as we all know, there is a big difference
          between mostly dead and all dead).

          You apply Tears of Lethe to food or drink. A creature
          that consumes that food or drink is subject to
          a dice pool check versus their Endurance.  If they fail they
          are rendered unconcious for one hour for each drop of the
          Tears of Lethe used.  A vial will typically hold d6 + 4
          drops of the Tears.  Each drop is represented as a die
          in the items magic pool.

          terracotta clay pot (about the size of an apple) and sealed
          with red sealing wax. when the white paste touches the air
          it expands and hardens.  If left openeed the foaming plaster
          expands to about the size of a small keg of beer.  The pot can
          be resealed with fire.  Each pot contains four small applications
          or one large one.

          There are many minor and highly specialized deities that
          spy on this world from planes both near or deep.  Hungry for
          attention they listen for prayers.  This slight book is dedicated
          to the small gods and contains the scrawlings of a gibbering
          prophet.  Amongst the deranged rambling text are 1d4 + 1 prayers
          to various highly specialized, highly obscure, and very minor
          deities.  When read the character may ask for a small boon
          from the god.     Once all the spells have been cast the book
          collapses into a different dimension in order to spread the word.
        </p>

        <p>
          The default chance to succeed is Very Difficult using a std check.
          The difficulty level can be reduced by one step if the character
          provides suitable embellishment for his prayer (e.g. the name of
          the small god, their varied domains, and their achievements).
          The difficulty level can be reduced by a further step if the task
          is very specific and very minor or increased by a step if the task
          is demanding of the small god.

          Snare scriptures are small books that appear similar to a Doctrine
          of the Small Gods.  This is not by unlikely coincidence.  As a spider,
          burning with hunger in the icy night of their existence, pale entities
          wait patiently for the unwary to read from their books which
          they carefully seed across the inner planes.

        <p>
          The Mirrors of the Prince of Shadows (Speculis Principes Umbras), are a
          set of silvered glass mirrors with brass frames carved with disturbing,
          other-worldly sigils.   They are transparent from one side and reflective
          from the other.   There purpose is to collimate ley line potential for the
          purpose of capturing ley energies.  When set up at the juncture of two or
          more Ley Lines they are able to concentrate Ley energy providing the caster
          with an extra +6<d12/> magic energy, only at that point and only for rituals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyone who gazes into the mirrors must check verses Willpower with difficulty
          12 or gain a temporary insanity condition.  The character can attempt to save
          against the condition once per day until they do so.

          This greenish looking stub of chalk is actually a powerful magical item that
          enables a magic user to draw a circle on a surface and create a magical
          portal that leads to a nearby location.  In order to make the chalk work the
          users must make a difficulty 5 check using their magic pool.  The portal created
          is a swirling translucent gate, but not transparent, vortex.  Furthermore the
          destination of the portal is chosen by magicks beyond the
          control of the user, though the destination is generally benign.
