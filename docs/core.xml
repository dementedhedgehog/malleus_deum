	Malleus~Deum is a fantasy pen and paper, tabletop, role-playing game (RPG).	
        In Malleus Deum one player assumes the role of Game Master or <defn>GM</defn>
	and plays the part of a narrator in a collaborative story.  Other 
	players adopt the role of individual people within the story, called <d4/> <d6/> <dpool/> <dany/>
	Player Characters.  All the other people, and any monsters within the story
	are controlled by the GM and are referred to as Non-Player Characters or 
	<defn>NPCs</defn>.  We  use the term  
	<defn>Character</defn> to denote the set of both player characters and non-player
	characters.
      </p>

      <p>
	<indexentry>Check<subentry>Difficulty</subentry></indexentry>
	Each player character is described by a Character Sheet. Any narrative decisions 
	of moment within the game are made by <emph>Making Checks</emph> which involves 
	rolling dice, adding any bonuses from the character sheet, and comparing the result
	to a <defn>Difficulty</defn> level
	<equation>
	  <line>Check:</line>
	  <line>Dice + Bonus <geqqsymbol/> Difficulty</line>
	</equation>
	The details of how this all fits together, how to make a character sheet, how to 
	make checks, and more is covered in the next few chapters.

    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Motivation and Design</sectiontitle>
      
      <p>
        This game has the following design goals:
      </p>

      <olist>
        <li>
	  <p>
	    The authors believe that the big name RPGs are showing their age.  Dungeons
	    and Dragons is now 40 years old.  While there are a large number of indie rpgs
	    that have explored interesting new rpg design elements, Dungeons and Dragons
	    has remained relatively static, its development ossified by negative feedback
	    to changes from its large existing fan-base.  These rules represent a response
	    to this state of affairs.  
	  </p>	
	  
          <p>
	    Malleus Deum is an attempt at a <emph>modern</emph> rule set.  It  
            tries to integrate advances in RPG rule design into an otherwise traditional RPG 
            rules system.  Specifically we try to include an Aspect-like mechanic from FATE, 
	    linear magic-users like 13th age and Dnd5e, a strategic initiative phase from Dr 
	    Who to encourage non-combat resolutions, simple unified resolutions, morale,
	    and adding benefits and complications to dice results.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
	  <p>
	    In this game we are trying to deemphasize combat.  Not remove it.  But
	    take an opportunity to try and provide rules that will allow the GM
	    to shine the light on other parts of the game: negotiation, morale,
	    fleeing and pursuit, investigation and personal development.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    It's nice to have a 
	    change in pace and scenery.  We have tried to design a game where combat 
	    plays a major role, but other aspects of the game, such as role-playing, 
	    negotiation, non-lethal combat, and investigation, are also a possibility.
          </p>
        </li>
	
        <li>
          <p>
            We feel it is important for users of the game that the game license allow people
	    to contribute to the game on their own terms and have, therefore, released the
	    game under the Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0, which is available 
            online.  In a nutshell, you are free, to:

              <li>Attribution — You must attribute the work in the manner specified by

            Modular and Customizable: Our goal is that you should be able to include the bits 
	    you want, exclude the bits you do not, customize whatever you like, add whatever 
            house rules you like, then build your own set of rule books and modules and
	    print them.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Modularity also makes maintaining balance in an evolving game easier
	    as some parts of the system can be tweaked without effecting other parts.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Moderately heavy-weight rules complexity means that the rules are a little more 
	    complicated than, for example, FATE, FUDGE, Basic Dnd, or Call of Cthulhu and a 
	    little less complicated than say DnD4e.   Combat needs to be easy enough that 
	    GMs can throw challenging encounters together on the fly.  But the rules for 
	    character progression need to be rich enough to capture and keep the imagination
	    of the players.
          </p>
        </li>      


	<li>
	  <p>
	    Geared to a low magic setting.  At high level magic becomes difficult to GM
	    with a myriad of unforeseen interactions and unintended consequences.  In the
	    authors opinion, there are also problems with game balance in high fantasy
	    settings.  As George Martin said: ``If you look at The Lord of the Rings, what
	    strikes you, it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with
	    this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So you have a
	    sense of magic, but it's kept under very tight control.''.  We also refer the
	    interested reader to Sandersons Rules of Magic.
	  </p>
	</li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Malleus Deum is designed for fantasy settings.  We feel that generic role playing 
            systems do not fit any milieu particularly well - they are the jacks of all trades 
            and masters of none.

      <sectiontitle>Character Overview</sectiontitle>
      <p>
        <indexentry>Character</indexentry> 
        Player Characters are described by:
        <list>
          <li>
	    <indexentry>Primary Attributes</indexentry>
	    A set of <defn>Primary Attributes</defn>: Strength, Endurance, Agility, Speed,  
            Luck, Willpower, and Perception.
	  </li>
          <li>
	    <indexentry>Secondary Attributes</indexentry>
	    A set of <defn>Secondary Attributes</defn>: Armour Class, Movement, Initiative,
	    and Experience
	  </li>
          <li>Two Hit Point stats: Stamina and Health.</li>
          <li>Three Dice Pool stats: Magic, Resolve and Fate.</li>
          <li>An Archetype and a Level.  The Archetype describes the characters race 
	  and their class or type.  The Level describes how advanced, how powerful, 
	  the character is.</li>
          <li>A set of Aspects. Aspects are statements that describe the characters 
	  personality, relationships, philosophy or appearance.   They 
	  have effects within the game, e.g: Silent Outcast, Naive Appeaser, Dipsomaniac,
	  Hairy Bastard, Declared vengeance against Elogh King of the Goblins.</li>
          <li>A set of Abilities, e.g: Sweeping Blow, Arcane Lore, Pick Locks, 
	  and</li>
          <li>Some optional description about the character. A back-story for the character, 
	  possibly some fame and any tertiary statistics the player might want to include: 
	  Height, Weight, Age, Hair Colour and so on.</li>
        </list>
	The characters attributes and aspects are used to determine whether the player 
	can successfully perform certain actions within the world.  Checks are described
	further in Section<ref>sec:checks</ref> on page<pageref>sec:checks</pageref>. 
	Steps to create a character can be found in Section<ref>sec:character_creation</ref> 
        on page<pageref>sec:character_creation</pageref>.

      <sectiontitle>Primary Attributes</sectiontitle>      
      <p>
        Every character shares a set of primary attributes.  Attributes are 
        numeric descriptions of a characters capabilities.  Initially they are values 
	between four and sixteen inclusive.
      </p>

      <subsection>
        <subsectiontitle>Strength</subsectiontitle>
	<indexentry>Strength</indexentry>
	<indexentry>Athletics<see>Strength</see></indexentry>
        <p>Represents the characters brute physical strength.  Strength checks are used to 
	bend bars, open doors and to lift heavy objects.  Strength modifies melee damage and 
	the characters Stamina.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
        <subsectiontitle>Endurance</subsectiontitle>
        <p>
          The characters ability to handle physical stress.  If a character has a high 
	  Endurance it indicates that they are healthy and tough.
          Endurance is used to oppose poisons, resist exhaustion, diseases, the cold, and 
	  modifies the characters Health.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
        <subsectiontitle>Agility</subsectiontitle>
	<indexentry>Agility</indexentry>
	<indexentry>Acrobatics<see>Agility</see></indexentry>
        <p>
          The characters ability to move easily; their nimbleness, athleticism and dexterity.
          Agility modifies the characters Armour Class.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
        <subsectiontitle>Speed</subsectiontitle>
	<indexentry>Speed</indexentry>
        <p>
          Speed represents how physically fast the character is.  Speed effects the 
          character's Initiative Modifier and their movement rate.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
        <subsectiontitle>Luck</subsectiontitle>
	<indexentry>Luck</indexentry>
        <p>
          A measure of how fortunate a player is.  Luck modifies a character's initial Fate
	  Pool.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
        <subsectiontitle>Willpower</subsectiontitle>
	<indexentry>Willpower</indexentry>
        <p>Willpower is the characters intestinal fortitude, their strength of character,
	commitment and firmness of mind.  Willpower contributes to a character's Resolve
	which is used to determine if the character breaks and flees from an encounter.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
        <subsectiontitle>Perception</subsectiontitle>
        <indexentry>Searching<see>Perception</see></indexentry>
        <indexentry>Spot Hidden<see>Perception</see></indexentry>

        <p>
          The character's awareness, acumen and insight.  Perception represents your 
	  attentiveness to detail and your unflagging vigilance.  In game this value is used 
	  socially, for reading people and detecting underhanded motives.  Perception modifies
	  the character's Awareness which is used both for surveying the surrounds for 
	  potential avenues of attack, and reduces the likelihood of being surprised.
	  Perception is used for searching.

        <term>Armour Class:</term>
        <description>
          A representation of how difficult a character is to hit.  A character may be harder 
          to hit because they are wearing armour or carrying a shield or even because of the
	  use of misdirection and guile.
        </description>

        <term>Initiative:</term>      
        <description>
          Initiative effects turn order during combat.

        <term>Experience:</term>
        <description>
          Is a numeric value that represents the development of the characters abilities
          due to the conflicts, trials and tribulations the character has had to face.
        </description>

        <term>Movement:</term>
        <description>
          Determines the number of squares a character can move when playing

	<description>
          <indexentry>Fate Pool</indexentry> 	  
          Characters have a <defn>Fate Pool</defn>.  Characters get a number of 
	  dice in their Fate Pool at the start of a session called the
	  <defn>Fate Rest Rate</defn>.  The Fate Rest Rate is the number of dice, of any
	  type, the character may return to their pool after a short rest.  Each character
	  also has a Maximum Fate Pool.  A characters Fate Pool cannot exceed this amount
	  and any Fate dice accrued above this amount are lost.  The Fate Rest Rate and the
	  Fate Maximum are specified by the characters archetype and their Luck.
	</description>
      </descriptions>
    </section>


    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Hit Points</sectiontitle>

      <p>
        A characters physical well-being is represented by two sets of 
        statistics: Stamina and Health.  Characters can take damage to either of
	these stats as the result of a single attack, however it is 
	more usual that attacks cause one type of damage.  Usually the character will
	take damage to stamina first and then health.  Stamina represents minor wounds
	and exhaustion, and heals quickly.  Health represents the actual physical status
	of the character and heals slowly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <indexentry>Zero Hit Points</indexentry>
        <indexentry>Consequences</indexentry>
        Hit points have a minimum value of zero.  After a character takes a hit to a given 
        hit point stat which reduces that stat to zero they have taken <emph>critical</emph>
	damage to that stat and the <emph>effect of the damage must be resolved</emph>.
	In order to resolve damage the GM may:
	<olist>
	  <li>Declare an outcome, or</li>
	  <li>Negotiate an outcome with the player and the party, or</li>
	  <li>Have the player roll on an appropriate Consequence Table.</li>
	</olist>
      </p>

      <p>
        At the GMs discretion, characters may also be forced to roll on a Consequence 
	Table when other events occur in game.  For example, the first time 
	the characters see a dragon the GM make make them roll on the Fear Consequence Table. 
	If a player is struck by a mountain giants club the GM may force them 
	to roll on the Crushing Blow Consequence Table.
      </p>


      <subsection>
        <subsectiontitle>Stamina</subsectiontitle>
        <p>
          <indexentry>Stamina</indexentry>
          Stamina is the characters ability to take superficial damage, bruising, 
	  flesh wounds, scratches, glancing blows, near misses and their aerobic fitness.  
        </p>

        <p>
          The first time damage reduces Stamina below zero during an encounter the player 
          must resolve the Critical Stamina Damage <emph>and</emph> any remaining damage 
	  is removed from Health instead.  Critical damage may be resolved on the Brawling 
	  Critical Table, or the Heavy Blow Critical Table.
        </p>

        <p>
          <indexentry>Healing <subentry>Stamina</subentry></indexentry>
          Damage to stamina leaves the character breathless, a little stunned, bruised and 
          battered but not physically too badly hurt.  	Characters regain Stamina at their
	  Stamina Rest Rate every short rest.
        </p>	
      </subsection>


      <subsection>
        <subsectiontitle>Health</subsectiontitle>

        <p>
          <indexentry>Health</indexentry>
          Health is the characters brawn, their physical capacity to take damage.
        </p>

        <p>
          <indexentry>Zero Health</indexentry>
          <indexentry>Death <see>Zero Health</see></indexentry>
          When a character reaches zero health they are effectively too hurt, too weak or 
	  too tired to defend themselves.  When a players Health reaches zero they roll for 
	  a Near Death Consequence.
        </p>

        <p>
          <indexentry>Healing<subentry>Health</subentry></indexentry>
          Health represents severe physical damage to the character.  It takes time to 
          restore health. The character gains Health back at their Rest Rate for every
	  day spent resting.
        </p>        
      </subsection>
      

      <playexample>
        <p>
	  Dourli, our amiable dwarven friend has somehow managed to find himself
          in a brawl with some of the town's thugs.  He punches one of the thugs in the face
          and rolls 7 Stamina Damage.  The thug has only 5 Stamina remaining so his Stamina 
          is reduced to 0, his Health is reduced by 2 and the thug has to roll on the 
          Stamina Consequence Table.  He rolls poorly and is knocked unconscious.

      </descriptions>     

      <p>
        A characters initial skills are determined by his or her archetype and by using a 
        point-buy system.  The characters archetype assigns a number of skill points 
	for each of the five different skill point types.  During character creation the 
	player chooses which skills or abilities they would like their character to have 
	and pays the purchase price for that skill in skill points.  Skills and 
	abilities are discussed further in Chapter<ref>ch:abilities</ref> on 
	page<pageref>ch:abilities</pageref>.

	<indexentry>Archetype</indexentry> 	
        Each character has an archetype.  An <defn>Archetype</defn> is a combination of a 
	race and a class, for example a character might choose to be a Dwarven Shield 
	Warrior or a Halfling Rover.  Archetypes define which abilities and skills 
	a character may have or learn and how hard it is for them to acquire that ability.

        Archetypes are indivisible because it makes them more modular and allows us to balance

	<indexentry>Level</indexentry> 	
        Each character has a level which represents how much experience the characters has.
	The character's level usually starts at one and increases when the 
        character has accumulated enough experience. 
      </p>

      <p>
	Experience is measured using experience points (XP) which are awarded when the
	character achieves goals within the narrative.  The number of XP required to
	increase in level is determined by the character's archetype.

      <sectiontitle>Aspects</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	Aspects are descriptions about a characters personality, their relationships or 
	their appearance that tie those descriptions to the game mechanics and allow checks 
	to be made against them.  Aspects are defined in great detail in chapter 
	Chapter<ref>ch:aspects</ref> on page<pageref>ch:aspects</pageref>.  We describe the 
	process by which aspects are assigned to new characters in
	Section<ref>sec:character_creation</ref> on character creation.

      <sectiontitle>Background</sectiontitle>

      <p>
        Players may create a background or back-story for their character.  At least 
        some of the players background should be fleshed out at character creation time.  The 
        background helps to tie characters to one another and to give them a purpose and a 
        feeling for how they fit in the world.

      <sectiontitle>Making Checks <label>sec:checks</label></sectiontitle>

      <p>
	<indexentry>Check</indexentry> 	
        In this chapter we describe <emph>Checks</emph>.  Checks are the core mechanic of
	the game.  Checks are used to determine whether a character
	can do things, like climbing a wall, closing a protective circle, or jumping a
	horse over a fence.   

	In order for a player's character to perform a challenging action they
	must make a <defn>Check</defn> which involves rolling some dice, possibly adding a
	modifier and determining whether the total of the roll and modifier is greater than
	some difficulty, if so the check succeeds, otherwise it fails.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	There are two varieties of check: Std 2d8 Checks, and Dice Pool Checks.  These
	determine what dice are used in the check.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Standard Checks</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	<indexentry>Standard Check</indexentry> 	
	<indexentry>Check<subentry>Standard</subentry></indexentry>
	Standard Checks are the simplest and most common check.
        In order to make a <defn>Standard Check</defn> or <defn>Std 2d8</defn> the player
	rolls 2d8, adds any relevant bonus, and the check succeeds if the total dice result
	rolled is greater than or equal to the task's difficulty.  The <defn>Difficulty</defn>
	is a number that represents how hard it is to perform the task at hand. 
	<equation>
	  <line>Standard Check aka Std 2d8:</line>
	  <line>2d8 + Bonus <geqqsymbol/> Difficulty</line>
	</equation>

	  <indexentry>Standard Check<subentry>Benefit</subentry></indexentry> 
	  <indexentry>Standard Check<subentry>Consequence</subentry></indexentry> 	  
	  There are certain special results that, when rolled on the Std 2d8 Checks, 
	  trigger unusual effects, granting  either a <defn>Benefit</defn> or 
	  a <defn>Consequence</defn> to the character, as follows:
        </p>

	<subsubsection>
          <subsubsectiontitle>Double 1s</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    Is always an automatic failure.  In addition the character
	    receives a significant consequence.
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>

	<subsubsection>
          <subsubsectiontitle>Double 3s, 5s and 7s</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    If the player rolls any other odd double result then their character
	    receives a consequence.  
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>

	<subsubsection>
          <subsubsectiontitle>Double 8s</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    Is always an automatic success.  In addition the character
	    receives a significant benefit.
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>


	<subsubsection>
          <subsubsectiontitle>Double 2s, 4s and 6s</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    If the player rolls any other even double result then their 
	    character receives a benefit.  
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Benefits and Consequences</subsectiontitle>

	<subsubsection>
          <subsubsectiontitle>Benefits</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    Whether the check succeeds or not, through skill or luck, the character 
	    has gained some advantage in the check.  When the character gains a benefit
	    the GM can describe the benefit or may allow the player to call the result, 
	    describing the result of the check to the rest of the table.  The player is 
	    allowed to add some minor advantageous secondary effect to the result.  For 
	    example, the opponent could be pushed back, drop the scroll they are carrying, or 
	    be forced to make a break check.  As always the GM is the final arbiter of 
	    whether a players call is reasonable and he may temper the results of the success, 
	    as he chooses.
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>

	<subsubsection>
          <subsubsectiontitle>Consequences</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    Something has gone wrong.  The GM should describe some additional bad 
	    outcome for the check or roll on one of the failure tables for inspiration.  
	    For example, the character may have struck with the flat of the blade 
	    (requiring the weapon to make a save), they may have lost their footing, 
	    left themselves open to attack or dropped some item they were carrying.
	    In other words, some adverse affect applies.  The GM should decide 
	    on an appropriate consequence for the character, or roll on
	    one of the blunder tables for inspiration.  
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>

	<playexample>
          <p>
            Dourli has to make a quick getaway from a burning stable surrounded by 
            a crossbow wielding gang.  The one horse inside the stable is panicking
            because of the fire.  The GM decides that the task has a difficulty of 14, so 
	    Dourli must roll a 14 or more in order to get the horse under control.  Dourli 
	    doesn't have Horsemanship or Animal Husbandry but he does have a fairly high 
	    strength.  Dourli attempts to control the horse using strength.  Dourli 
	    has a strength of 13 and so gets a bonus to his role of +3.  Dourli rolls a 
	    pair of fives on his 2d8 for a total of 10 and adds the 3 to get 13 which isn't 
	    enough to make the 14 required to control the horse.   In addition, because he 
	    rolled double odds he suffers a consequence.  The GM declares that the horse 
	    bolts, smashing through the burning stable doors and running into the night.
          </p>

      <sectiontitle>Dice Pool Check<label>sec:dice_pool</label></sectiontitle>
      <p>
	<indexentry>Dice Pool Check</indexentry> 
	<indexentry>Check<subentry>Dice Pool</subentry></indexentry>
	Dice pools  represent some finite resource that will run out if overused,
	e.g. Magic, Fate and Resolve.  When the player has to make a dice pool check
	they choose <emph>however many dice they want</emph> from their dice pool and
	roll them to try and get a result within a certain range.
	<equation>
	  <line>A Dice Pool Check succeeds if:</line>
	  <line>Difficulty <leqqsymbol/> Dice Result &lt; Over-Charge</line>
	</equation>
      </p>

      <p>
	Some Dice Pool Checks may not have an Over-Charge value.  But if the check has an
	overcharge and the player rolls greater than or equal to the overcharge then they
	succeed, but some bad over-charge effect occurs.  If they roll under the Difficulty
	then they fail.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<indexentry>Dice Pool Check<subentry>Exhaustion</subentry></indexentry> 
	<indexentry>Check<subentry>Dice Pool Exhaustion</subentry></indexentry>
	None of the special Benefit/Consequence rules for Std Checks apply to dice pool
	checks.  However, when a dice rolls a one, that dice that dice is said to be
	<defn>Exhausted</defn> and is remove from the dice pool.  For character dice pools
	like Fate, Magic and Resolve the dice pools will have a rest rate which allows
	the player to return dice to his dice pool over time or when certain events occur.
	For magical items and other dice pool checks the loss might be permanent.  Exhaustion
	only applies to Dice Pool Checks, not Std 2d8 Checks.
      </p>

      <p>
	A characters dice pools are defined by their archetype, level and skills.

      <sectiontitle>Types of Check</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	There are many different types of Check.  When choosing which one to use
	the rule of thumb is use the check most specific to the task at hand.  We describe
	the types of check here in decreasing order of specificity; so another apporach
	is to pick the first check that applies from the following list.
      </p>	 

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Ability Checks</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  The most common type of check is an ability check (or skill check).  Combat
	  to-hit rolls are ability checks using the appropriate weapon skill, as are
	  spell casting checks using the appropriate magic skill.  For these checks the
	  dice used, the modifier and a suggested default difficulty are provided in the
	  ability description.  Note that the difficulty is a suggestion for the GM who
	  may override it as they desire.
          <indexentry>To Hit Check</indexentry>
          <indexentry>Checks<subentry>To Hit</subentry></indexentry>
	</p>

	<playexample>
	  <p>
	    Dourli attempts to strike a thug with his axe using the Axe Strike ability
	    which he has at Level 1.  He rolls Std2d8 + 2 and the difficulty is the thugs
	    armour class.  The +2 bonus is provided by his 1st level Axe Strike ability.
	  </p>
	</playexample>	  
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Opposed Ability Checks</subsectiontitle>	

	<p>
	  <indexentry>Check<subentry>Opposed</subentry></indexentry>
	  <indexentry>Opposed Check</indexentry> 
	  An <defn>Opposed Check</defn> tests one characters ability against another.
	  Instead of checking against a difficulty the character checks against their
	  opponents check result for the same ability.  In case of ties no-one wins.
	  <equation>
	    <line>Opposed Ability Check</line>
	    <line>
	      Std2d8 + Mod. &gt; Std2d8 + Opponents Mod.
	    </line>
	  </equation>	
	</p>

	<playexample>
	  <p>
	    Dourli wants to sell some information to the thieves guild.  One of his
	    party members opposes the idea.  Dourli tries to negotiate to get his way.
	    As Negotiate is an Opposed Ability Check both Dourli and his opponent roll.
	    Whoevers modified roll is higher wins.
	  </p>
	</playexample>

	<p>
	  When making an opposed ability check against an NPC the GM can state
	  a difficulty for the player to beat (converting the opposed ability check
	  into a normal ability check).
	</p>
      </subsection>
      

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Aspect Checks</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  Aspect checks are standard checks against the aspects difficulty.
	  They are discussed further in Chapter<ref>ch:aspects</ref> on 
	  page<pageref>ch:aspects</pageref>.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Attribute Checks</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
          <indexentry>Checks<subentry>Ability</subentry></indexentry>
          <indexentry>Ability Check</indexentry>	    
	  Attribute checks are checks made using one of the characters
	  attributes, when no more specific check applies, e.g. a character
	  might check their speed when running from an avalanche.
	</p>

	<p>
	  For Attribute Checks the character rolls a Std 2d8 modified by the
	  characters Attribute modifier, see Table<ref>table:attribute_modifers</ref>
	  on page<pageref>table:atttribute_modifers</pageref> for a list of
	  attribute modifers.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The difficulty for these attribute checks is chosen by the GM, see
	  Table<ref>table:std_check_difficulties</ref> on
	  page<pageref>table:std_check_difficulties</pageref> for a list of
	  suggested difficulties.
	</p>

	<playexample>
          <p>
            Dourli tries to shift a large wine barrel that is sitting on a trap door 
            in a cellar.  The GM declares that in order to do so Dourli must make a strength 
            check with a difficulty of 12.  The player rolls a 3 and a 4 on their 2d8.
	    Dourli has a Strength of 13, and so gets a bonus of +4 for a total of 11.  Dourli 
	    fails to move the wine barrel. 
          </p>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Opposed Attribute Checks</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  Opposed attribute checks involve two sides making an attribute check against
	  each other.  The difficulty for the check is the other sides check result.	    
	  <equation>

	    <line>Std2d8 + Mod. &gt; Std 2d8 + Opponents Mod.</line>

	</p>

	<playexample>
          <p>
	    Consider the intrepid Dourli holding a door shut while two thugs try to
	    open the door.  This could be played as an opposed Str attribute check
	    or the GM could just make Dourli make a regular Str Check against some
	    stated difficulty chosen by the GM.

	  Encumbrance is an optional rule.  When the characters are doing something
	  where the weight of their pack could be problematic then the GM can make the

	<subsectiontitle>How often can you Check?</subsectiontitle>

	<p>
          <indexentry>Skills<subentry>Check Once</subentry></indexentry>
          Each character can perform a check once.  For example, Dourli might
          try opening a box by picking locks.  If he fails he can try opening the box
          with his axe but he can't try picking the lock again.  In addition, someone 
          else can try and pick the lock.
	</p>      
      </subsection>

      
      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>How often can you Check?</subsectiontitle>
	
	<p>	  
	  As a GM when should you require that your players make a check?  Make sure that 
	  you only require players to check when: <emph>the outcome is uncertain and failure 
	  makes the game more interesting</emph>.  Many tasks are easy enough that they can be 
	  completed automatically.  In this case no check is required to perform the action. 
	  Harder variants of the task might require a check though.  For example, opening a 
	  door might be considered an easy task that automatically succeeds, while opening a 
	  door quietly might require a check.  Similarly breaking down a door might require 
	  a check to perform quickly but can be done automatically given enough time and 
	  given that one of the characters has an axe.  
	</p>

      </subsection>     



      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Party Checks</subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  Sometimes checks have to be made by more than one character in the party.  In this
	  section we discuss the different party checks.
	</p>

	
	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Everyone Checks</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    <indexentry>Everyone Checks</indexentry> 
	    <indexentry>Checks<subentry>Everyone</subentry></indexentry> 
            Sometimes everyone in a group has to make a check.  For example, if the party is 
            attacked using poisonous gas everyone in the party has to save.  When 
            <defn>Everyone Checks</defn>, each group member makes a separate check
	    independent of the rest of the group and each individual suffers any
	    repercussions separately if they fail.
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>


	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Proxy Checks</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
            In a proxy check <emph>someone</emph> makes a check to represent the efforts
	    of the whole group.  If the check fails everyone in the party suffers any
	    effects. There are three types of Proxy Checks: <emph>Lowest Checks</emph>,
	    <emph>Anyone Checks</emph> and <emph>Highest Checks</emph>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <indexentry>Lowest Checks</indexentry> 
	    <indexentry>Checks<subentry>Lowest</subentry></indexentry> 	  
	    <indexentry>Anyone Checks</indexentry> 
	    <indexentry>Checks<subentry>Anyone</subentry></indexentry> 	  
	    <indexentry>Highest Checks</indexentry> 
	    <indexentry>Checks<subentry>Highest</subentry></indexentry> 	  
            When the <defn>Lowest Checks</defn> the player whose character has the lowest 
	    bonus makes the check <eg/> when sneaking.  Conversely, when the
	    <defn>Highest Checks</defn> the player whose character has the highest bonus
	    makes the check, <eg/> for perception checks.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    In the interest of game pace we suggest the GM chooses a character that is the 
	    approximate highest or lowest to perform the check.  It may not be completely 
	    accurate but it is fast and it helps to share the dice rolling load around.
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>


	<subsubsection>
	  <subsubsectiontitle>Chained Checks</subsubsectiontitle>
	  <p>
	    <indexentry>Chained Checks</indexentry> 
	    <indexentry>Checks<subentry>Chained</subentry></indexentry> 	  
	    <indexentry>Ascending Chained Checks</indexentry> 
	    <indexentry>Checks<subentry>Ascending Chained</subentry></indexentry> 	  
            In a <defn>Chained Check</defn> members of the group check in rough order of 
	    their relevant ability.  Chained group checks come in two flavours: Ascending
	    and Descending.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    In an <defn>Ascending Chained Check</defn> the character in the group with
	    the lowest relevant bonus checks first, then the second-lowest and so on until
	    someone succeeds.  Usually there are repercussions for characters who fail 
	    an ascending chained check.  For example checking to see who breaks and 
            flees from battle uses an ascending chained check using Resolve.  Everyone who 
            fails rolls on one of the break resolution tables.
	  </p>

	  <p>
            Again, the GM should feel free to use an approximate ordering of the characters to 
	    save time and spread the action, e.g. just choose a character that is likely to
	    have a low bonus for the descending check.  Any effect that this approximate
	    ordering has on the outcome should be considered due to the fickle winds of fate.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    <indexentry>Descending Chained Checks</indexentry> 
	    <indexentry>Checks<subentry>Descending Chained</subentry></indexentry> 	  
            A <defn>Descending Chained Check</defn> starts with the character with the highest 
	    bonus checking first and then the second highest and so on until a player
            succeeds.  For example if the party are trying to run off a rope bridge
	    that is being cut by some goblins.
	  </p>

	  <p>
            Difficult chained checks may require more than one success at the GMs discretion,
            that is multiple party members have to succeed before the check is successful.
	    So, for example, we might write this as <emph>Ascending Resolve Chained Check 
	    x2</emph> for a check that requires two resolve based successes with the characters 
	    with the lowest bonuses going first.
	  </p>
	</subsubsection>

	  <subsection>
          <subsectiontitle>Assisting Checks</subsectiontitle>

<p>
Chained checks and group checks can be assisted.  Players declare that they will 
assist after the initial check has been rolled.  In order to assist a player's 
character must have some logical way of assisting in the check and the player 
of the assisting character then has to roll and pass the check themselves.  If they 
do this the initial check is modified by +2.

      <sectiontitle>Tags</sectiontitle>
      <p>
        <indexentry>Tag</indexentry> 
	A <emph>Tag</emph> is a label or signifier attached to a character, monster, or 
	scenario in the world. A cellar might be <emph>dark</emph> and <emph>musty</emph>.  
	If the GM describes a cellar as being dark then we say it is tagged dark, a dwarven 
	character is tagged dwarven.
      </p>

      
      <p>
	Characters may use tags to gain an advantage in a check.  They may also be prerequisites
	for using abilities, describe weapon damage types, properties that effect magic use,
	monster classes etc.

          Dourli hides from a local gang of thugs in a cellar.  The GM describes the 
          cellar as dark and dank and storing old barrels.  The thugs enter the cellar 
          and look around.   Dourli invokes the dark tag of the cellar saying "They'll 
          have trouble seeing me in the dark.".  The GM agrees the difficulty of the 
          thugs search is increased and the thug's.

      <sectiontitle>Aspects</sectiontitle>

      <p>
        <indexentry>Aspect</indexentry> 
	Aspects are special tags that describe some facet of a characters personality, 
	their system of beliefs, personality traits, or their appearance.  Each aspect has
	a difficulty and the player can be forced to make checks against the aspects
	difficulty.  The higher the difficulty the harder it is for the character to resist
	the aspect. For example Dourli might have the following aspects: <emph>Gold is my
	Lodestone 8</emph>, and <emph>My Word as a Dwarf 10</emph>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Role-playing is shared story-telling.  Conflict and struggle are central to a 
	good story.  Aspects are the mechanic that we use to represent facets of the 
	characters personality that can be used to create interesting, non-physical,
	conflict and character development within the game.
      </p>

      <p>
	There are many types of aspects.  They fall loosely into the following categories:
      </p>

      <descriptions>
	<term>Personality Aspects</term>
	<description>
	  <p>
	    describe a characters personality their flaws and foibles, their short 
	    comings their weaknesses and sometimes their strengths, e.g. Mama's Boy,
	    As Exciting as Cold Oatmeal, Suspicion Haunts the Guilty Mind.
	  </p>
	</description>

	<term>Philosophy Aspects</term>
	<description>
	  <p>
	    encode a character's beliefs and their moral compass: Defender of the 
	    Downtrodden, Man of the Book, Laws are like Spider's Webs, Hold Fast.
	  </p>
	</description>

	<term>Relationship Aspects</term>
	<description>
	  <p>
	    Relationship aspects can be used to describe a close bond between the
	    character and an individual, or a small group or even a large population.
	    In the last case it comes in the form of Fame, or infamy, with aspects
	    like The Heroes of Izenholme, or The Scourge of the Serpent People.
          </p>	    

          <p>
	    Discuss the role playing milieu with the GM.  Get a feel for the colour of 
	    the world and the NPCs and organizations within it.  Choose 
	    an aspect with the GM that ties your character to one of these 
	    NPCs or organizations: Chosen of the Elvin Council, Beholden to the 
	    Black Hand.  Alternatively choose a relationship with one of the player 
	    characters.
          </p>
	</description>
	
	<term>Appearance Aspect</term>
	<description>
	  <p>
	    If you have an appearance aspect then there is something about your character 
	    that is visibly notable, <eg/> Eyes of Midnight Black.  Dourli might pick
	    <emph>A beard to die for.</emph> for example.  Town criers might call out a
	    wanted description for payment regarding information leading to the apprehension
	    of a dwarf with a particularly fine beard.  Girl dwarves might find Dourli
	    particularly irresistible. 
	  </p>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Compelling and Resisting Aspects</subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  <indexentry>Compelling an Aspect</indexentry> 
	  <indexentry>Aspect<subentry>Compel</subentry></indexentry> 
          The GM and players may attempt to <defn>Compel</defn> any characters aspect at 
	  any time.  Compelling involves suggesting to a player that their character should 
	  follow a course of action in keeping with one of their aspects.  The player who 
	  controls the character may then choose to <bold>accept</bold> or <bold>resist</bold> 
	  the compel.  
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the player <emph>Accepts a Compel</emph> for an aspect then they should have 
	  their character behave in accordance with that aspect.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <indexentry>Resisting an Aspect</indexentry> 
	  <indexentry>Aspect<subentry>Resist</subentry></indexentry> 
	  Alternatively, players may have their characters try to <emph>resist the 
	  compel</emph>.  They may perform a standard check against that Aspects difficulty.  
	  If they fail the check their character must perform an action that is congruous 
	  with the aspect in question, <emph>and</emph> increase the difficulty of the 
	  aspect by one up to a maximum of 13.  See Figure<ref>fig:compel_aspect_table</ref>.
	</p>

	<!--
	    Think about what this will do to the line numbers?

<include>tables/compelling_aspects.xml</include>

	-->
	{% include "tables/compelling_aspects.xml" %}


	<playexample>
          <p>
            Dourli hears that someone has offered 20gp for information 
            about one of Dourli's colleagues.  The GM might decide to try to compel Dourli as 
            he has an aspect <emph>Gold is my Lodestone</emph>.  The player then decides 
            whether he will accept the compel and provide the information about his associate
	    or resist the compel.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    He decides to resist.  So he has to check against the 
	    difficulty of that aspect, which is 8.  He rolls 
	    2d8 (as aspect checks are standard checks) and rolls a total of 7.  He fails 
	    as his dice result, 7, is lower than the aspects difficulty, 8.  So now Dourli has 
	    to provide the information about his associate in order to garner his well earned 
	    cash.  In addition, because he failed the aspect check he increases 
	    the difficulty of the aspect by one, to 9.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Dourli now  decides that he cannot, 
	    just hand over the information about his associate, like a despicable cad, and 
	    instead resolves to try and give them bogus information.  This action satisfies 
	    the compel as, if he succeeds, he still gets his gold.
          </p>
	</playexample>

	<p>
          Conversely, a player can compel their own aspect in order to gain an  
	  advantage, provided the GM agrees to the compel.  When a player compels one of 
	  their own aspects they roll the check as normal.  If they fail the aspect 
	  binds the character.   If they succeed the check the aspect does not apply
	  and no advantage is gained.  However, the character must now reduce the 
	  difficulty of that aspect by one. 
	</p>
      </subsection>


      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Aspect Difficulty and Lifetime</subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  Aspects need not last the lifetime of the character.  
	  There are a limited number of aspects a character may have at any one time.
	  Characters grow and over time the beliefs that shape them change and aspects 
	  they once described them may no longer apply.  For example, a character might 
	  hold certain beliefs very strongly and, overtime, the strengths of those beliefs 
	  may wane.  After some period, the character may become disenchanted with their 
	  former philosophy and move on.   Perhaps they grow and realize the error of their 
	  ways, or maybe the continue to believe but the passion in them has gone.  
	</p>

	<p>
	  The difficulty of an Aspect always lies in the range 5 to 13.
	  Aspects acquired during character creation have an initial difficulty of $d4 + 4$. 
	  Aspects whose difficulty falls below five are said to be <bold>diminished</bold> 
	  and no longer apply to the character.  They may be removed from the character 
	  sheet or demoted to a tag.
	</p>


	<p>
	  Alternatively, the GM may at any time declare that a character loses an existing 
	  aspect, gains a new one, or he may reword an existing aspect.  The GM should take
	  care when doing this to keep the players vision of their character intact.
	  You should consider modifying the characters aspects for one of the following
	  reasons:
          <list>
            <li>Manageability: if the character has too many aspects consider removing 
	    some, preferably starting with those with the lowest difficulties.</li>
	    <li>To satisfy the Narrative Imperative: if adding the aspect to the 
	    character would drive the story forward in interesting ways.  This might 
	    happen as the result of some traumatic event or epiphany.</li>
	    <li>To tweak an existing Aspect: if the aspect is constantly being exploited 
	    by the player then the aspect should be changed.  Remember a good aspect 
	    has to cause problems for the character occasionally</li>
	  </list>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Other aspects, such as physical aspects, are usually held for the lifetime of the 
	  character.  For example, suppose Dourli loses a hand in a tragic, yet potentially 
	  foreseeable, drunken axe juggling attempt.  He gains the <emph>Missing Left 
	  Hand</emph> aspect.   Over time this may become much less problematic for him as 
	  he adapts to his new condition however he will very likely retain that aspect until 
	  his death.  Alternatively, the GM can rule that aspect can be diminished and 
	  if Dourli manages to get the aspects difficulty down to 5 then it no longer 
	  affects him in the usual course of play.  That aspect would then become a tag
	  on the character -- just because it no longer effects him in a significant way.
	</p>
	
      </subsection>



      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Aspect Advantages</subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  When a player seeks to compel one of their own characters aspects they do so 
	  in the hopes of receiving an <defn>advantage</defn> and or weakening the 
	  hold of that aspect upon their character.  An advantage comes in one of two 
	  forms.  Often it will be restoring a die to one of their dice pools, or
	  bonus to a dice roll.  Alternatively the <emph>player narrates</emph> the 
	  result of a subsequent check.
	</p>

	<playexample>
	  <p>
	    Suppose Dourli is fighting an ogre, and a large amount of treasure is 
            at stake if Dourli can win.  The ogre is nearly defeated but Dourli fails 
	    his break check.  Dourli's player might try to compel his 
	    <emph>Gold is my Lodestone</emph> aspect to try to get the GM to give 
	    Dourli some bonus to his break check in that fight.  He rolls a 3.
	    Well under the aspects difficulty and so is bound by the aspect.
	    The GM grants him an extra $d6$ for his break check roll.   Dourli also
	    decreases the difficulty of this aspect as he successfully compelled his
	    own aspect.
	  </p>
	</playexample>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Conflicting Aspect</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  Sometimes a characters aspects conflict with one another.  In such cases 
	  someone can compel one aspect to try and gain an advantage on a second
	  aspect check, e.g. suppose the GM tries to compel Dourli's <emph>Gold is 
	  my Lodestone</emph> aspect to make Dourli sell out one of his companions.
	  The player may counter that Dourli has claimed his friendship with the 
	  companion while imbibing and that the GMs compel conflicts with his other 
	  aspect <emph>My word as a Dwarf</emph>.  If Dourli <emph>fails</emph> the 
	  check against <emph>My word as a Dwarf</emph> then he is bound by that aspect
	  and the GM should grant him an advantage in the check against 
	  <emph>Gold is my Lodestone</emph>.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Crafting Good Aspects</subsectiontitle>

	<p>
          Good aspects are evocative of the characters personality, their belief system 
          or their social status. They should not describe parts of the game already covered 
          by existing game mechanics.  For example, <emph>Greatest Swordsman Ever</emph> is 
          not a good aspect - it interferes with the game rules on combat.  <emph>Thinks He's
          the Greatest Swordsman Ever</emph> is much better because it establishes the 
          character as a braggadocio.  Remember that the Aspects should be chosen to create 
	  conflict and problems for the characters to overcome.  If an Aspect does not 
	  cause the character to overcome difficulties or make interesting decisions it
	  is not a good aspect.  We have included some example Aspects in 
	  Table<ref>table:{{ doc_name }}_random_aspects</ref> on
	  page<pageref>table:{{ doc_name }}_random_aspects</pageref>.

    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Overview</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	This chapter describes abilities available to characters in the game.
      </p>     

      <p>
        <indexentry>Abilities</indexentry> 
	<indexentry>Skills<see>Abilities</see></indexentry>
	Each character has a set of <defn>Abilities</defn>.
	Some abilties allow the player to perform <defn>Actions</defn> or 
	<defn>Ability Checks</defn> while others provide the player with passive advantages.  
	Skills may be used in a variety of ways depending on the skill in question.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Abilities are tags and like other tags, they may be used by the player 
	to gain an advantage in an appropriate context.  
      </p>

      <p>
	Many abilities have a cost that players must pay in order to acquire the ability.
	As players increase in level they get more points to purchase additional abilities.
	Some abilities are innate - they have zero cost and the character is assumed to
	automatically have the ability at first level.	
      </p>

      <p>
	<indexentry>Mastering a Skill</indexentry>
	<indexentry>Skill<subentry>Mastery</subentry></indexentry>
	Some skills have prerequisites.  In order to use one skill as a prerequisite for 
	another the character must first have mastered the skill.  In order to master the skill
	the player must have used the skill and achieved the appropriate number of successes 
	and failures using that skill.
      </p>

    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Ability Progression</sectiontitle>

      <p>
        <indexentry>Ability<subentry>Progression</subentry></indexentry> 
	For a character to increase an ability level they potentially need to satisfy four 
	conditions: Prerequisites, Training, Mastery and Reflection.  Most abilities will
	require some or all of these conditions to be met before the ability can be attained.
      </p>

      <p>
        <indexentry>Innate Skills<see>Skills Innate</see></indexentry> 
        <indexentry>Skills<subentry>Innate</subentry></indexentry>
	Innate skills are considered to be either instinctive or have been learned in the 
	characters childhood.  Most characters in the game are assumed to have these skills by 
	default. This includes things like jumping, climbing and speaking a language or two.  
      </p>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Prerequisites</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
          <indexentry>Prerequisites<see>Skills Prerequisites</see></indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Skills<subentry>Prerequisites</subentry></indexentry> 
	  Some skill levels have prerequisites.  These prerequisites must be met before 
	  the new skill level can be attained.  Prerequisites are generally of two types:
	  minimum primary attribute requirements, e.g. Strength > 13, and other skill 
	  prerequisites, <eg/> Maths I is a prerequisite for Alchemy I.  An ability does 
	  not have to be mastered in order to be used as a prerequisite for another skill.
	  But a character cannot attain the next level of an ability without mastering the
	  current level, <eg/> you must have mastered Maths I before you can gain Maths II,
	  but mastery is not required to satisfy the prerequisite for Alchemy I.

	<p>
          <indexentry>Training<see>Skills Training</see></indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Skills<subentry>Training</subentry></indexentry> 
	  Training represents the time spent studying or practicing a skill and is represented
	  using skill points.  When a character goes up a level they receive skill points.  
	  Those skill points can be used to learn new skills and abilities.  
	</p>
      </subsection>

          <indexentry>Training<see>Skills Mastery</see></indexentry> 
          <indexentry>Skills<subentry>Mastery</subentry></indexentry> 
	  In order for a character to attain a higher level of a skill they already have
	  they must first have mastered the existing skill level.  Listed beside the 
	  skill level in their archetype description will be the number of successes
	  <success/>, attempts <attempt/> or failures <fail/> of the ability is required
	  before that skill level is mastered.   During the course of a game the player is
	  required to keep track of the progress of unmastered abilities.

      <sectiontitle>Combat Overview</sectiontitle>
      <p>
	<indexentry>Combat<subentry>Rounds</subentry></indexentry> 	
	Combat is central to the game and has its own specific set of rules.
	Combat starts with an optional <emph>ambush</emph> or <emph>surprise</emph> check,
	an optional <emph>Talk Phase</emph>, an initiative roll, and then a series of
	<defn>Combat Rounds</defn>.  In each round all the characters involved perform a
	single action.  The order in which actions are performed in the round is determined
	by the type of the action and the characters initiative.  Each round lasts six seconds.
      </p>
    </section>

      <sectiontitle>Ambush and Surprise</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	It is possible for some groups within a fight to be unprepared for battle or 
	completely taken off guard.  For game purposes we say that a group of characters can 
	be either ambushed or surprised.  <defn>Ambushing</defn> is a planned attack on a
	hopefully unsuspecting enemy.  <defn>Surprise</defn> represents occasions when two
	unsuspecting groups run into one another with no prior knowledge of the confrontation.
      </p>
      

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Ambush <ambushsymbol/></subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  In order for one party to Ambush another they must be <defn>aware</defn> of that 
	  parties presence or approach and the party being ambushed must be unaware of the
	  ambushing party.  Ambushing requires that an opposed party check be made that 
	  tests the ambushers Lowest Hide ability versus their opponents parties Highest
	  Detect ability.  The actual abilities used in these checks depends on the environment
	  in which the ambush occurs, see Table<ref>table:{{ doc_name }}_awareness</ref> on
	  page<pageref>table:{{ doc_name }}_awareness</pageref>.  If successful the opponents
	  are ambushed and receive a $-5$ to their initiative rolls.  If the attempt fails
	  the opponents are off-guard and suffer a <emph>-2</emph> to their initiative.
	  Recall that if the party has no chance of successfully ambushing they should not
	  be checking at all.
	</p>

	{% include "tables/awareness.xml" %}
      </subsection>


      

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Surprise <surprisesymbol/></subsectiontitle>

	<p>
          <indexentry>Surprise<subentry>Rounds</subentry></indexentry>
	  Surprise occurs when one or more parties arrive at a combat and were unaware of
	  the other parties presence, but <emph>were</emph> expecting trouble.  Usually
	  surprise happens at the start of combat or when new combatants suddenly arrive
	  to an existing fight.  Whenever there is the potential for combatants to be
	  surprised then a <defn>surprise round</defn> occurs.  If a surprise round occurs
	  mid-combat then initiative is rerolled.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A surprise check is the same as an ambush check with the following two differences.
	  Firstly when two parties meet both parties may be suprised.  This is not the case
	  with ambushing.  Secondly, if a party fails a surprise check then they are off-guard
	  and suffer a <emph>-2</emph> modifier to initiative.  If a party succeeds in their
	  check then they are not surprised and no modifier is applied.
	</p>

      </subsection>



      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Talk <talksymbol/></subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  The <defn>Talk Stage</defn> is optional, but can be used by the GM and the players
	  for character development, plot development and as a means to achieve strategic
	  ends.
	</p>

	<p>
	  As a means of character development the Talk Stage provides an opportunity for
	  the the NPCs to trash talk the player characters, brag about their achievements
	  or reveal their motives.
	</p>

	<p>
	  An important role of the Talk Stage is to drive the plot.  It allows the GM
	  to provide narrative information to the players, exposition,
	  colour and possibly the denoument, "Luke, I am your Father".
	</p>

	<p>
	  Finally, the Talk Stage can be used as a strategic tool by either the
	  players or the NPCs to avoid combat, negotiate a surrender, or forge alliances:
	  <eg/> if the guards need to arrest the PCs they can ask them to come quietly.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The Talk Stage only occurs if one side is predisposed to talking and the
	  other side is capable of understanding the attempt at communication.  The
	  Talk phase does not happen after an Ambush (presumably the ambushing side
	  is committed to an attack).  Similarly a surprised party cannot initiate
	  the Talk phase.  If a surprising party initiates decides to initiate the
	  Talk Stage they lose any advantage they gained from Surprise.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The party being communicated with needs to understand that an attempt is
	  being made to communicate.  For example, a charging bear probably won't
	  stop and have a chat with the player characters, while a group of Orcs may or
	  may not depending on how hungry they are.  Usually, rational and intelligent
	  characters will talk, if given the opportunity, in an attempt to try and avoid
	  combat and reduce the chances of their own death.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      
      <playexample>
	<p>
	  XXXXXXXXXx
	  
          The thugs have returned to the cellars.  Dourli and Roslyn have been unable to 
	  escape and now a fight looks inevitable.  It's still dark and our heroes have 
	  managed to hide from the thugs so far.  Dourli attacks the thugs from his 
	  hidden position attempting to ambush them.  The GM notes that the Thugs will
	  be expecting trouble and he can only attempt to surprise them.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Dourli tries to get advantage from the <emph>dark</emph> tag of the cellars.
	  The GM agrees and gives him a <emph>+1</emph> arguing that the fact that the
	  thugs were expecting to find Dourli down here would somewhat negate that advantage.
	  Dourli agrees.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Roslyns Sneak is a lot better than Dourlis, so Dourli rolls his Sneak in an opposed
	  check versus the Thugs best Notice or Listen.  If Dourlis Sneak Roll is higher
	  than his opponents roll they will be surprised and their initiative roll
	  will be reduced by $-2$.
	</p>

      <sectiontitle>Initiative <initiativesymbol/></sectiontitle>
      <p>
	<indexentry>Turn Order</indexentry>
	<indexentry>Initiative</indexentry>
	The order in which actions occur during combat rounds is
	<emph>partially</emph> determined by initiative.  Before combat starts players
	roll their initiative dice.  Their characters <defn>initiative</defn> for the
	rest of this combat is the total of this roll including any modifiers for
	surprise or ambush.  The GM may choose to add or subtract any other contextual
	modifier as they see fit.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Combat Rounds</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	<defn>Combat rounds</defn> are divided into five <defn>Stages</defn>.  
	Each stage is a set of actions all of which happen at roughly the 
	same time.  They are: Start, Fast, Standard, Slow and End.  Characters 
	that choose actions in the earlier stages will always go before characters who 
	chose actions from the later stages.   In other words, if your character 
	chooses to run in the Start stage they will run before anyone else has a chance
	to attack them.
      </p>

      <p>
	There are four other special combat stages: ambush, surprise, talk and initiative
	which happen before combat starts and have been discussed previously.
	We also define a <defn>Non-Combat Stage</defn> for actions that can only occur
	outside of combat, <eg/> doing research in a library.  Breaking the combat down
	into stages allows us to describe when abilities may be used.
      </p>
   
      <p>
	Finally, there are a few extra complications to combat: Reactions, Free Actions,
	Movement, Miscellaneous Actions, and Prepared Actions which we discuss later. 
      </p>

    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Action Order</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	Within a round the order that actions are taken in is determined by an 
	auction.  The character with the <emph>lowest initiative</emph> that has not performed
	an action during the round declares, or bids, the action they would like to perform.
	Any character that has not performed an action yet, this round, may then bid a
	faster action.  No character may bid more than once and bidding is optional.
	An action is faster if its stage, is faster (<eg/> Start Actions are faster than
	Fast Actions, and Fast Actions are faster than Standard Actions <etc/>), or if
	its stage is the same as the current fastest action and the character has a higher
	initiative.  In other words stage is the most important factor in determining action
	order, initiative is the tie-breaker.  When no more bids have been made the auction is
	over and the fastest action is chosen.  After an action is chosen the auction
	process starts again until all characters have used their actions.  This may seem
	like a complicated process but usually there will be only one or two bids per auction.
      </p>

      <p>
	Some important notes about the action order auction are:
	<olist>
          <li>
	    Lowest initiative goes first.
          </li>
	  
          <li>
	    Each character can only bid once per auction.
          </li>

          <li>
	    Each bid must be faster than the last bid.
          </li>

          <li>
	    The fastest action wins.
          </li>

          <li>
	    Only one action, the fastest action, gets performed per auction.
          </li>	  
	</olist>
      </p>

      <playexample>
	<p>
	  XXXX FIXME:
	  
          Dourli and his ally Roslyn, has been cornered by the local gang leader Fenton 
	  One-Eye and two of his thugs.  A fight in the cellar of the Inn has been 
	  underway for some number of rounds.  During the fight a few kegs of whiskey 
	  have been smashed and there is a shallow pool of whiskey on the ground.  Dourli 
	  rolled 7 for his initiative, Roslyn rolled 8, Fenton rolled 9 and his two thugs 
	  rolled 6 (as a group).  
	</p>

	<p>
	  The thugs go first, having the lowest initiative, and declare they will charge 
	  Dourli, a type of Melee Attack.  Dourli interrupts their turn, as he has a higher 
	  initiative and declares he will throw a torch onto the whiskey, a Ranged Attack. 
	  Dourli is able to do this because ranged attacks are at a higher stage than
	  melee attacks.  Roslyn wants to attack the thugs with her quarter-staff but 
	  cannot because Reach Attacks are at a lower stage than Missile Attacks, 
	  she decides to wait.  At this point, Fenton can declare any interrupt action in 
	  the ranged attack stage or higher.  Not being armed with a missile weapon 
	  and having serious misgivings about being caught in an inferno in such 
	  confined spaces he declares that he will Run, which occurs in the Run stage.
	</p>

	<p>
	  At this point the actions have all been declared, because there is no one left
	  to interrupt, and the actions are now executed in this order:  Fenton runs for 
	  it, Dourli throws the torch and the Thugs are caught in the flames.  These 
	  actions are now regarded as having happened.  Any subsequent actions happen
	  after the actions described thus far.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Roslyn is the only character who has not performed an action at this stage and 
	  since that also makes her the remaining character with the lowest initiative she
	  declares whatever action she pleases knowing that she cannot be interrupted.
	  After Roslyns action is executed there are no characters with remaining actions
	  and so a new turn starts.

      <sectiontitle>Combat Details</sectiontitle>


      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Free Actions</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  Normally characters are allowed a single action during a combat round.
	  A <defn>Free Action</defn> is an action that does not count against this limit.
	  Only one free action may be performed by an character in any single combat round.
	</p>

      </subsection>
      
      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Movement</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  Most combat actions also implicitly include some optional movement.  When a
	  character attacks it is understood to involve a movement to close the distance to
	  their opponent.  On a grid the distance the character may move is up to the
	  characters movement.  Note that there is also a Run action that essentially just
	  allows the character to move twice in a round, a Charge action for attacking at
	  a run, and a Flee action.  In addition, the characters movement options may be
	  curtailed if they have failed one or more Break Checks.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Reactions <reactionsymbol/></subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  <indexentry>Reactions</indexentry>
	  Under certain circumstances a character will be able to perform an additional
	  <defn>Reaction</defn>.  These Reaction will be triggered by some other players
	  action.  Reactions can occur either after or during the triggering action. A
	  character can only perform a reaction if they have not performed their action
	  yet.  A character may only perform one out of turn action per round.  Some examples
	  of reactios are: Shield Block, Sword Parry and Dodge.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Miscellaneous Actions <actsymbol/></subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  <indexentry>Miscellaneous Actions</indexentry>
	  Miscellaneous actions refer to things that characters do during combat
	  that are not actually fighting actions: <eg/> reading the runes that close
	  a magic portal, releasing a portcullis, mounting a horse, quaffing a potion,
	  pushing a load of barrels over and so on.
	</p>

	<p>
	  For many miscellaneous actions the GM will just have to make a ruling as
	  to the check required and the stage in which the action occurs as it would
	  be impossible and infeasible for us to provide rules for the myriad of
	  miscellaneous actions that might occur.  When doing this we strongly suggest
	  that the GM make most Miscellaneous Actions occur in the Fast Stage.
	  This will encourage players to choose these actions and make for more varied
	  combat encounters.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Prepared Actions</subsectiontitle>
	<p>
	  If the character knows that a combat is iminent they may declare that they
	  prepare an action.  At that point, at the GMs discretion, the action becomes
	  a reaction and occurs at one faster stage than normal, <eg/> a prepared arrow
	  shot triggered when someone enters a room would occur in the Start Stage.

      <sectiontitle>Non-Lethal vs Lethal Combat</sectiontitle>
      
      <p>
	There are two categories of combat.  Lethal and Non-Lethal.  In Non-Lethal 
	combat the participants are not actively trying to kill their opponents, but 
	rather trying to subdue them or drive them off.  Most combat with humans 
	and their like will be non-lethal.	
      </p>

      <p>
	In non-lethal combat you use the non-lethal damage of the weapon and 
	that damage is recorded against the targets Stamina.  When the targets stamina 
	reaches zero the attacker chooses whether the target Flees or Yields.
      </p>

      <p>
	In lethal combat you use the lethal damage of the weapon and that
	damage is recorded against the targets Health.  When the targets health
	reaches zero they start making Near-Death rolls.
      </p>

      <p>	  
	Examples of typical non-lethal combat encounters include fights with the local 
	guards, barroom brawls, fights with gangs of thugs and bandits.  There are 
	many reasons to use non-lethal combat: killing people is often a capital crime 
	in human society, there are severe social implications when an individual 
	becomes known as a killer, potentially the players might wish to interrogate 
	an opponent, bandits might want to make money selling people into slavery.
      </p>	  

      <p>	  
	It is possible for one set of combatants to be fighting using non-lethal combat
	while their opponents use lethal combat.   It is also possible to start 
	fighting using either lethal or non-lethal combat and then to switch to the 
	other type of combat.

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Miniatures vs Theatre of the Mind</subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  <indexentry>Movement</indexentry>
	  Combat may either be performed on a table with miniatures using a map with a grid, 
	  or purely narratively using the theatre of the mind.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If the combat is taking place on a grid then the map determines 
	  the distances for movement, spell area of effect, missile weapon range etc. 
	  On a map a run is simply a double movement, a charge is a movement + d6 extra 
	  squares then an attack if the enemy is in range.  Fleeing characters move twice 
	  their movement rate +d6 extra squares.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Movement is halved over <defn>difficult terrain</defn>.  
	  Difficult terrain included: muddy ground, terrain with a lot of debris, brambles etc.
	</p>        

	<p>
	  <indexentry>Range</indexentry>
	  Missile weapons and some spells have a range.  Beyond that range they cannot be 
	  effectively used and they automatically miss.  The range may be subdivided into 
	  short range and long range.  Attacks at <defn>long range</defn> attract a +3 to-hit 
	  difficulty.
	</p>

	{% include "tables/combat_modifiers.xml" %}	

	<p>
	  <indexentry>Cover</indexentry>
	  Cover provides modifiers to hit for most missile weapons and for melee combat.
	  <defn>Light cover</defn> afforded by bushes, the curve of a hill and the like 
	  gives a +3 to hit difficulty, <defn>Hard cover</defn>, such as a half wall, 
	  provides a +6 to hit for missile weapons, melee weapons and some spells.  
	  <defn>Full cover</defn> makes hitting the target impossible.  The GM should feel 
	  free to choose a to-hit modifier that fits the cover available to the characters.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <indexentry>Reach Weapons</indexentry>
	  Some weapons, like spears, have <defn>reach</defn>.  During combat weapons 
	  with reach attack before normal melee weapons <emph>on the first round</emph>.
	</p>

      </subsection>


      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Attacks of Opportunity and Engagement</subsectiontitle>

	<p>
	  A character in hand-to-hand automatically <defn>engages</defn> their opponent.  
	  Typically, characters can engage only one opponent at a time, but may be engaged 
	  by many characters simultaneously.  
	</p>

	<p>
	  If a character is engaged then any action that causes them to move away
	  from the character that has engaged them triggers an <defn>attack of opportunity</defn>
	  against the moving character.  An attack of opportunity is simply an additional 
	  melee attack as a free action.  Recall that characters may only perform one free 
	  action per combat round.

      <sectiontitle>Break Checks <label>sec:break</label></sectiontitle>      
      <p>
	<indexentry>Break Checks</indexentry>
	Both player characters and monsters may, from time to time, be forced to make a 
	break check.  In order to make life more manageable, the GM and 
	player characters make break tests differently.
      </p>

      {% include "tables/break_consequences.xml" %}        

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Player Character Break Check</subsectiontitle>       
	<p>
	  <indexentry>Breaking</indexentry>
	  <label>sec:breaking</label>

	  For player characters <defn>break checks</defn> are made using the Resolve pool.  
	  Any characters who fail the check must roll on one of the Break Resolution Tables.
	  <equation>
	    <line>Break if:</line>
	    <line>Resolve Pool <leqqsymbol/> Break Difficulty</line>
	  </equation>	  
	</p>

	<p>
	  As characters fail break tests they gain conditions that limit what they can
	  do during combat, and subsequent break checks become more difficult, see
	  Table<ref>table:break_difficulties</ref> on
	  page<pageref>table:break_difficulties</pageref> for a list of break test
	  difficulties and conditions.
	</p>

	<p>
	  For example, looking at the table, the first time a character makes a break
	  test during combat they do so with a difficulty of 8.  If they fail they gain
	  the Checked condition and further break tests are made with a difficulty of
	  12.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The GM should feel free to modify the break difficulty as he pleases, <eg/>
	  to reflect being attacked at night, being vastly outnumbered, the horrible
	  visage of the characters opponents, the party being in good spirits etc.
	</p>	

	{% include "tables/break_difficulties.xml" %}	

	<p>
	  Break tests for players should be made:
	  <list>
	    <li>After the party member becomes bloodied,</li>
	    <li>After all party members have become bloodied,</li>
	    <li>When the party enters combat against a fear causing opponent,</li>
	    <li>Whenever the party is surprised.</li>
	  </list>          
	  Ultimately though, it is up to the GM to decide when the players should make a 
	  break check and the GM should feel free to make the sooner or later in the combat 
	  so that they align with pivotal events in the combat.
	</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection>
	<subsectiontitle>Monster and NPC Character Break Tests</subsectiontitle>       

	<p>
	  Monster stat blocks include a default break difficulty for the monster as a 
	  suggestion to the GM though ultimately it is up to the GM's discretion to choose 
	  an appropriate break difficulty for the monsters.    For example, say a party of 
	  adventurers attack a kobold temple, the kobold priests are enraged at the desecration 
	  of their temple so the GM determines that their break difficulty should be reduced, 
	  but the kobold guards have seen some of their compatriots flee already and so their 
	  break difficulty should be increased.  
	</p>

	<p>
	  Break tests for monsters and opposing NPCs should be made when:
	  <list>
	    <li>The first time a monster dies during an encounter,</li>
	    <li>After a third of the monsters have died,</li>
	    <li>After two thirds of the monsters have died,</li>
	    <li>Whenever the monsters are surprised.</li>
	  </list>          
	</p>

	<p>
	  In the interests of keeping the game flowing, if there are more than say five 
	  monsters then the monsters should be grouped together for the purposes of their 
	  break tests.  For example, imagine there are 15 kobold guards in the combat, the 
	  GM should group them as three groups of five for the purposes of testing to see 
	  if they break.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If monsters lose their break test they must attempt to disengage, bargain their 
	  way out of the conflict, play for time, or flee as the GM pleases.  The GM is 
	  free to roll on one of the Break Resolution Tables for inspiration.

      <sectiontitle>Foreshadowing and Outs</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	For combat to be interesting strategically it is important that there
	be a chance of failure.  However, as combat is highly lethal combat may
	result in a total party kill, which is a generally undesirable outcome.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	There are two approaches to solving this problem.  The first is to make
	sure that the characters are able to win the combat by providing deliberately
	easy foes.  While this works, if overused it leads to a dull combat experience.
      </p>	  	     

      <p>
	The second approach to solving this problem is to provide an <defn>Out</defn>
	for the party should things go south. For example if the characters are fighting
	slavers and they lose then they can be enslaved and the game continues.  If
	they are fighting Orcs they may be kept for food later.  The city guards might
	throw them in the dungeon if they prevail against the party.
      </p>


      <p>
	A sub-type of the Out is the Deus Ex Machina.  In this case the party is
	saved right at the last minute by some third-party.  This is generally undesirable
	from a narrative perspective as it leads the players to believe that whatever
	they do some third-party will save them at the last minute, thus reducing tension.
      </p>

      <p>
	The trick to making Outs feel less contrived is <defn>Foreshadowing</defn>.
	As a GM, you should provide information to the characters about the Out so that
	if and when you have to use it the development in the narrative is less jarring.
	For example, if characters are trying to contact the elvish border guards in the
	Grey Forest and you, as the GM, know they are just about to run into giant spiders
	have the characters hear the guards trumpets in the distance.  If the players
	are fighting slavers, let them know that there have been slaver raids taking place.
	Also it is a good idea to plant these foreshadowing seeds earlier rather than later.
      </p>

      <p>
	In summary, to avoid combat annihilation try to have an Out for the characters
	before the combat.  Use foreshadowing in order to make the out seem less contrived.
      </p>

      <sectiontitle>Random Encounters</sectiontitle>

      <p>
	Random encounters are events that happen to the party that are not instigated
	by the party. Random encounters serve two primary purposes in the game:
      </p>

      <list>
        <li>
	  Random encounters provide a disincentive for the characters
	  to camp and ``turtle''.  The threat of constant danger should
	  encourage them to keep moving forward, and to keep the story
	  moving forward as well.
        </li>

        <li>
	  Random encounters do not all have to be bad.  They can be used to provide
	  the characters with useful information.
        </li>
      </list>

      <p>
	In order to determine when a random event occurs determine the threat
	level of the characters locale.  In the wilderness the threat level might
	be in the range 4 to 6.  In an enemy stronghold it might be 8 to 12.  Get
	one of the players to roll a standard check against that difficulty.  If
	they fail a random encounter occurs.
      </p>
      
    </section>
    


    <section>
      <sectiontitle>Fighting in Groups</sectiontitle>
      <p>
	It is possible to fight in groups.  While fighting in a group the
	front row provides hard cover to the back row.  The front row must
	have at least as many people in it as the back row.  To make melee
	attacks from the back row you must be using a weapon with reach.
	It is possible for a group to have two front rows, i.e. to be fighting
	on two fronts, provided that the number of people in each front row
	is greater than or equal to the number of people in the back row.
	Furthermore, characters in the back row add a temporary bonus die to
	their break tests.

      <p>
        <indexentry>Encumbrance</indexentry>
	<indexentry>Check<subentry>Encumbrance</subentry></indexentry>	
	Encumbrance is an optional rule.  The characters total encumbrance is a 
	difficulty level that tests may be made against.  For example, characters 
	climbing a mountain may be made to make an Endurance check against their 
	encumbrance or become exhausted.   A character leaping from one roof 
	to another who gets a consequence in their check may be forced to roll 
	a speed or agility check against their encumbrance or drop some equipment
	into the streets below.
      </p>

      <p>
	In order to use encumbrance you must be using the standard character sheets.
	In the equipment section of the character sheet, marked against the side, are
	encumbrance values for each class of item (small, medium and large) and values
	for armour and coin.  The total of these values is the characters encumbrance.	
      </p>

      <p>
	If used, it is important that this rule does not become a long-winded exercise in 
	accounting.  First roll the check, then calculate the encumbrance (if required).
	Secondly, don't worry about getting the value exactly right - it will take to long.  
	Just eye-ball it.
