        <term>Mook</term>
        <description>
	  Mooks are monsters that go down easy.  Any boon that hits, kills a mook instantly.
        </description>

        <term>Plot-Armour</term>
        <description>
	  The monster is important to the story.  Critical successes will not instantly kill them.
	  These monsters can reroll checks to escape or die at the GMs discretion.  Rerolls are
	  made with the addition of the ability rank on top of any other modifiers.  This does not
	  mean the monster is unkillable, just harder to kill.
	  This protection	lasts until such time as the GM deems it is dramatically appropriate for
	  the monster to die.
        </description>

        <term>Swarm</term>
        <description>
	  This monster is actually a swarm of small individuals acting as one.  Most weapons do only
	  one point of damage.  Crushing weapons do half damage.  Area of effect attacks do maximum
	  damage against a swarm.
