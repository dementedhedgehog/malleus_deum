will wants larger area for abilities on the character sheets.

abilities.. too many attempts..
  i) pick some abilities at first level from a list.
  ii) reduce the mastery requirements for non combat abilities.

give additions to abilities.

 PROBLEMS:     

    open problems
        ability tree complexity.
	the role of attribute modifiers in abilities
	pursuit
	no high level spells? (is that a bad thing?)
	breaking??? 
	rests?
	character creation too complicated
	leveling up!
	balance


atuning magical items??

counter magic.. ??
channelling?

adventure

monster balance

fellowship phase??

keystone levels?
spells - components, gestures?

make long bows .. require that the user not have the Short tag!

ABILITY..
 - Perceive ability goes away (it's very close to a perception check?  .. no leveling up!!)
