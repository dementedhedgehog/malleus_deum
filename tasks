Make languages a lore ability.  Make languages a specialization
patron .. lilith
patron .. fey queens?


Checks vs Saves.  d20 vs d20/d20.
Saves for misfortune etc..
BUT DONT CALL IT SAVE (CAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THAT ALREADY).


ADD SAVING THROWS FOR ALL ABILITIES
DO WE WANT TO REPLACE METTLE CHECKS WITH WILLPOWER CHECKS?
WHAT DO WE DO WITH LUCK (constant DC?) AND MAGIC CHECKS???


CHECK, SAVING-THROW, EFFECT
CHECK well understood has all the fields
SAVING-THROW always d20+rank
COUNTER-ACTION OR REACTION??? "trigger" and "effect"




DEFENCE SAVE
  Player rolls
  OPTIONAL? Boons/Banes ... Attacker
  Crits ... Attacker?



**** WHEN CHECKING WHO SPECIFIES THE DC, BOONS AND CRIT BEHAVIOUR? ***


Simple Check.  The Check specifices everything.

Check with Opposed Save.
 - e.g. Sword Strike vs Shield Block
 




What about monster actions that have nothing to do with a particular party member?


 Action economy..
 - having three actions the same like pathfinder provides more strategic engagement.  *****
 - Also need free actions and reactions and the 1/2/3 action count from pf2e
output [lowest 1 of 3d20] named "double disadvantage"
output [lowest 1 of 2d20] named "disadvantage"
output [lowest 1 of 1d20] named "normal d20"



CURRENT QUESTION..
  - SHOULD WE DO FOLLOW UP EFFECTS LIKE HAMMER SMASH (1 ability 2 checks) OR LIKE RIGHTEOUS BLOW (2 abilities with a trigger) OR BOTH?  ADs vs DisADs?
  - I THINK THE (2 abilities with a trigger) IS BETTER (each ability is simpler)
  - PROBLEM method 2 doesn't require the player to make strategic decisions



FIXME: sort out npc attacks.. (SPELLS ETC.. DO WE NEED A SPECIAL VERSION OF EACH?)
  does the pc want to roll high or low (high).
  PC rolls a DC against the DC of the passive attack
  Monster abilities should basically be a range, an effect, keywords, dmg (crits etc .. determined by players save? or crit fails??)
  SAVE ABILITIES DONT IMPOSE A CRIT FAIL ETC.  THATS IMPOSED BY THE MONSTER ATTACK?? WHAT ABOUT PVP?
  COUNTERACTION ... 
How do monsters cast spells???  .. The PCs save against the effect.

RENAME COUNTERCHECK TO SAVING THROW

ANOTHER QUESTION .. DEFENCE ABILITIES...


tasks... enforce counterchecks SAVES -> have only a bonus (rank) and a DC , and npcchecks have a dc, crits, boons etc (but the crit successes are good for the players and bad for the NPCs).  defence is a special class of countercheck/save used for physical attacks (includes dodge, shield block, parry, etc) where the DC is the Target's Attack.



 NOTE: during PVP players are considered to have the plot-armour ability.   DEFINE PLOT ARMOUR


*Player-Facing* abilities are abilities where an NPC performs an ability and the roll for the check  is made on behalf of the PC by the player (or sometimes by the GM).   These abilities have a CHECK and a DC(=number+Rank) and CRITS.  These are separate abilities because we want to maintain the roll high is good for the PC idiom.

Monster vs Monster.. GM rules by fiat.  Roll a die if you feel it will give you inspiration as to the outcome.  Nobody wants to
see the GM play the game with themselves.


effect, righteous-effect?  happens on that result or higher?
fail-effect, grim-fail-effect happens on that result or lower?


 An npc attacks a pc with a magic missile.
 The pc uses shield block.
 Whose crit and boon bane and crits should apply? the attackers Magic Missile ability or the pcs Shield Block
 - USE PCs boon bane, attackers crits. (because if the pcs use magical defences they have to pay for it).
 - USE NPCs crit values?




Sprint.. need a definition for natural sprinters... (double move in an encounter)

Theurgic Oath.. Aspect ..
and oaths in general?

FIXME: remove no-checks?

 NPC checks..
 DC SHOULD BE THE PLAYERS DEFENCE


Last stand .. die reaction.  no heals.


GMs guide.  Make sure that all the monster keyword enum things are described somewhere?
 

CHANGE fate die to Gods... add a heedless result.  Add the cost there?  PROVIDENCE?  indifferent.
Monsters generally don't roll and when they do they don't roll fate dice and don't get crits


Do we need initiative??


mettle of a group starts at the max of the mettles of the members of the group.
the peacemakers

Most specific rule applies... (critical success is a righteous success etc, ).



make "healing" after an encounter.. then it will scale for dungeons and hexcrawling. ??
beastmen .. gors etc.. krampus, centaurs, minotaurs



rename polearm to spear.. in ability ids


three strikes and you're out.  ???? what does this mean?  For lore/repeated checks.

siddhis - for plague doctors
Akelarre - witches sabbath
Basajaun
Zugarramurdi - town in spain


 --- LEVELS AND SPECIALIZATION ---
X  REMOVE GROUP FROM ID.
X  Then there's only ability and specialization
MAKE ONE SYNTAX FOR SPECIALIZATION (NOT .blah and [blah])
REMOVE CODE FOR PARSING OLD ABILITY GRAMMER.
UPDATE RPG.XSD IF IT SUPPORTS ABILITY GRAMMER??
 

HOW DO WE DEAL WITH SPECIALIZATIONS IN OUR ACCOUNTING?
They're NOT TOO IMPORTANT FOR BALANCE - CALL THEM LEVEL 4 AS A ROUGH APPROXIMATION?  OR GIVE THEM THEIR OWN RANK?



 --- XXX ---

WHAT ABOUT SHIELD?
HOW DO WE DO HALF DAMAGE?  Fail .. Ablates damage e.g. d8, d6 etc?  critical fail ablates no damage .. shield break test.

MASTERY
1 = Critical Fail, >1 & <DC-8 Grim Fail, >=DC-8 & <DC Fail, >=DC & <DC-8 Success, >=DC+8 Righteous Success, 20 critical success

FATE
Natural 1 = DAMNED,  < 8 BANE, > 20 BOON Result , Natural 20? BLESSED


The rule must be that things that require success must use success and righteous success


unfortunate -> pool costs are double
fortunate -> pool costs are halved

fate die?


REVISIT THE BANE BOON terminology?


NEEDS A HOOK??

DO WE NEED A CHECK FIELD?   e.g. d20+Rank+Ag??? (BETTER TO TARGET DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES  Ag, Spd, Willpower etc?)


game session (some effects .. Brilliant Planner.. have scope of the current session. define it somewhere)
define Appropriate size... (this is an effect that refers to monster size for abilities like grab which won't work on monsters too large... see creatureSizeKeywordEnum in the rpg.xsd file.   applicable size for an ability for a character is any creature size up to one larger than the size of the character ... e.g. for medium creatures applicable sizes are large creatures or smaller, for small creatures applicable sizes are medium creatures or smaller).
DEFINE BASIC ATTACK one with the basic attack keyword
DEFINE TEMPORARY HITPOINTS

RENAME LUCKY to FAVOURED BY THE GODS

FRENZY CONDITION??
ADD THROW AXE ABILITY

Overflow damage.
Deus Vult.. theurgic.  extra attack

WHAT DO WE NEED FROM OUR STATS?





Specializations and levelling up/
A specialization counts as a new ability.
Subability?




Catergories of players..

Half Caster T Defence 3  Attack 2
Half Caster S Defence 2  Attack 3
Full Caster   Defence 2  Attack 2
Urchin?       1 1 

Where do casters fit in?
Are Strikers melee only fighters?  what about rangers?
What abour ranged strikers?


SHOULD I ALLOW RANKS OF -2 etc?



You can't ignore me .. skill.
Extended opportunity attack.. for fighters .. when their opponent backs off.


 LEVELING>>  TRICK IS TO MAKE THE MAX LEVEL 5 for the big prereqs?
   SPACE OUT THE LEVELS SO THAT YOU AWARD EITHER PROMOTIONS OR NEW ABILITIES.


Go up to level 
*** How do I visualize it? ***


FOR MAGIC AND FOR FIGHTING
LEVEL UP TO LEVEL 6
  Then dependencies start at level 3.


FOR FIGHTING MAGIC USERS START AT level 1 martial, fighters at level 3
For Magic levels at 1.
For other things it doesn't matter too much as it doesn't directly effect fighting.

 Fate...
     magic overflow?? .. just make it a 1?  Then you roll on some table and add all the casting modifiers.
     what about a 1 on the other dice
     firing into combat.


 finesse? vs DC
    -> natural 1s always fail
    -> natural 20s always succeed
    -> add rank to this
    -> >= 20 triggers special* (might not hit!?)
    
    * fighting .. hit or miss .. special: trigger abilities and double damage
    * magic successfully cast or not
    * ability check -> what are specials?
    * aspects -> what are specials?

    



 fate
    -> melee .. double damage? (might not hit).
    -> magic.. low is wasteful of magic, high is efficient
    -> 1s are fumbles (use the fate to determine).
    -> 19s 
    -> 20s  





WHAT ABOUT >..

   ADD LEVEL TO BOTH ROLLS
      SPECIALS > 20
      Natural 1s are FUMBLES




 THE PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT WANTS FATE AND FINESSE TO BE INDEPENDENT BUT THEY ARENT
  SO WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM.

      add a skill when there are none left of that type.

   ii) We want to be able to visualize across archetypes and across levels within an archetype.

   iii) We're going to need to test whether the levels break constraints.. (e.g. no bad upgrades)

PROBLEM ... general, magical? are too generic to be useful.. is that a problem probably not I suppose?

QUESTION: should we have generic abilities that work on basic attacks or weapon specific abilties?   Why not both?


 - Rage - after you hit check rage .. get advantage to hit, must make a melee attack per round or roll a morale check, if you fail you stop raging and cannot rage again.
 - Cleave - extra attack after killing a monster
 - Frenzy - when you miss a melee attack you can check mettle 4 to do 1d4 damage instead.  This extra damage is then cumulative for all successful melee attacks for the rest of the combat

 - Wind of death.  melee attack with disadvantage for 2 + level opponents.

Morale...  make the effects of failing morale less proscriptive????
   - denies player agency??
   - instead apply softer pressure.
   - Checked need to roll a morale check to perform a bold move.
   - Broken martial actions are performed at disadvantage?

 more ghouls
 make the parlor empty.. carcasses picked clean hanging on some improvised bent steal hooks to keep them away from the rats.. gnawed bones in the corner.

 guards will ask them their names

 presumably go to johanns..
 
Sometime later the guards will come and arrest Matts character for non payment of taxes.

 If they're all in prison Bombur might turn up to offer a loan.. provided they can get it underwritten and with collateral.

 ghouls attack Johanns place at night or pfedermeister..
  One will knock on the door..  "I have a message for Johann.. or I have message for the owner of the pfedermeister"
 They will buy time while the others climb up the side of the house.
  Then that one will attack.

 New ghouls names are
 Fuad (heart) - leader middle aged man, sun bronzed man with a van dyke beard.
 Jabir (comforter) - blond man, short hair buzz cut, leather armour, short sword (which he will throw once),
 Yahya (gracious) - sullen looking, older man, skinny.  Will be left to question them.. told not to eat any of them until they've hung for a while or they'll make you ill.   Make them all very caring of one another.


 Out ... they'll carry them to a new larder and one of them on a hook, then they'll start questioning the others
 for a little bit..  Johann will be knocked out.  They'll want to go out and get more people for the rest of
 the month.  Leaving one alone with the characters.  See Lucia's questions..  They'll also see if they can
