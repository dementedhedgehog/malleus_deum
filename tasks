Review archetypes and add a level 2 to the table.


Morale...
dice pool  (no new mechanics required)
GM always rolls all the dice (so no player rerolls)


asylum
undercroft


MORALE - broken
TOO MANY HIT POINTS.. NOT ENOUGH CONSEQUENCES.. pull back on the refresh a bit (keep stamina as is).  Drop opening hit points a little for level 1 characters.
LACK OF EXTRA FIGHTING OPTIONS FOR FIGHTERS .. working on it.
BALANCE BROKEN .. therefore still a fair amount of fudging rules on the fly.


Fixes for Mettle.. remaining problems
  Demons Mettle
  Undead Mettle.


Add the morale pool graphs to the rationale doc.


 Make up an encounter block..


FIXME:
  Routed/Broken



Remove Checked Condition, Broken and Fleeing??  (think about the latter at least?)



add range to abilities
update ability graphs 

monsters .. aggression, self-control? willpower/control/composure.



Fuzzy Terminology
break test

Morale Checks  - cascading mettle checks with a DC of 5 (if you fail someone else has to check... partly to allow for "leadership" type skills, rerolls, bonuses etc).


MAKE HELD THE SAME AS BROKEN    UNDEAD AND TANGLEBRIAR?
MAKE TURNED THE SAME AS ROUTED? 
Turned (as in undead condition) forcing them to flee from the character or their allies for three rounds.. after which they will leave the area if able.

TOO MANY HIT POINTS.. NOT ENOUGH CONSEQUENCES.. pull back on the recovery a bit (keep stamina).
LACK OF EXTRA FIGHTING OPTIONS FOR FIGHTERS .. WORKING ON IT
BALANCE BROKEN .. therefore a fair amount of fudging rules on the fly.

 If they're all in prison Bombur might turn up to offer a loan.. provided they can get it underwritten and with collateral.

 ghouls attack Johanns place at night or pfedermeister..
  One will knock on the door..  "I have a message for Johann.. or I have message for the owner of the pfedermeister"
 They will buy time while the others climb up the side of the house.
  Then that one will attack.

 New ghouls names are
 Fuad (heart) - leader middle aged man, sun bronzed man with a van dyke beard.
 Jabir (comforter) - blond man, short hair buzz cut, leather armour, short sword (which he will throw once),
 Yahya (gracious) - sullen looking, older man, skinny.  Will be left to question them.. told not to eat any of them until they've hung for a while or they'll make you ill.   Make them all very caring of one another.


 Out ... they'll carry them to a new larder and one of them on a hook, then they'll start questioning the others
 for a little bit..  Johann will be knocked out.  They'll want to go out and get more people for the rest of
 the month.  Leaving one alone with the characters.  See Lucia's questions..  They'll also see if they can
