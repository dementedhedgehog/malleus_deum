make the abilities skills

group checks
median?

low
medium
high misc abilities?
general misc abilities


How do we lose bravery?????  Bold Moves.
when you fail to block or dodge you lose a dice from your dice pool?


change attacks of opportunity ... only happen when you run past (e.g. move from one adjacent square into another in the same round??)  Have a feat to let you do it.


defense... roll armour or dodge or block or parry (magical shield).  dodge, block and parry take a minor.  Interrupts take a minor.
Different defenses can be used against different attacks.

armour saves use the pool???  no cause then you can be unhittable??

chase scene reviews.


initiative...
like mearles????
but fast, medium and slow (d10, d8, d6)??
make it a group check
take the median result.
leaders etc can throw away the lowest dice. (problem no decision .. they'll always throw away the lowest.. make them roll bravery?)
DnD 5e side initiative.


rethink initiative?  group initiative??
rethink group checks??
have the players play in any order on their turn?????

block, dodge, parry.


Make attributes skills!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Change std check to 2d10
  - gets us a wider range (so more scope for improvement) and makes the


What's the relationship between abilities and attributes???
Make ability values the difficulties??  lower is better???
Get rid of abilities all together??


Use bravery for blocking etc


PROBLEM: Too wide a spread of attack to hit values ... 

Separate weapon proficiencies into "Proficiency" which gives bonus to hit and others which give special attacks.
ADVANTAGE: simple and keeps the ranges reasonable
PROBLEM: special attacks like attack multiple targets have the same damage etc?
SOLUTION: just make the proficiency level the base


Damage is weapon damage * tier (tier is 1, 2 or 3).

"click" for traps.

nephilim

  fix the weapons table.

 - MD work out rules (can choose a difficulty) 
 - MD what about roll to hit.. bonuses do X dmg + effect?, normal hits do y, double odds do z damage?
 - WHAT AM I GOING TO DO ABOUT DODGING ETC???
     - test your mettle??

what about making defense use bravery??

 DEFENSIVE ACTIONS


 BALANCE!!!
   - work out for each ability the weapon that does the most damage that the archetype can use.
     given an archetype and a skill work out the max damage?
   - need to get the number of levels for each ability
   - need max damage for each ability level
   - each ability needs a max to-hit + weapon??? + attr?   
   - each ability needs a max dmg bonus + weapon + attr??  weapon_class.. keywords.
   - each ability needs a max defense + weapon?? + attr??
   - each ability needs a strategic "rating"
     (can be used in combat but doesn't directly do damage)
   - each ability needs a flavour "rating".


MAKE CHOICE OF WEAPON A CHOICE..
 - axes .. plus vs doors and trees?
 - hammers plus damage vs armoured and skeletons.

 make all dice pools d6s?

 look at hankerins social encounters thing..
 rowcolor at the start of the column??

 consider making the dm passive??  .. will do!!! (dm can roll for damage)


 how do I stop people only using one ability?
   (don't make them special-purpose.. accurate, more damage, multiple targets, disarm etc).

      i) it's ok to skip it!
