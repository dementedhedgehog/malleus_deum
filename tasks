Make sure any actions mentioned in the combat section are actually actions
Make Sprint etc abilities.
Short Rest, Rest, Parlay ability.. (no leadership for the interrupt).


break checks..

	  <p>
	    Characters may choose to perform a <indexentry>Retreat</indexentry>
	    <defn>Fighting Retreat</defn>. In a fighting retreat each turn the character
	    may make an attack if they can, but then must move their full movement away from 
	    danger if they can.  They cannot move toward an enemy unless they have no other 
	    option.  Once an character starts to retreat they have to rally before they can
	    take an action other than Fighting Retreat or Flee as it takes great discipline
	    to force themselves back into the fight.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    A <defn>Hold</defn> action allows the character to stand and fight, but they 
	    may not advance.
