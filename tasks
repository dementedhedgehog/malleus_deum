 more ghouls
 make the parlor empty.. carcasses picked clean hanging on some improvised bent steal hooks to keep them away from the rats.. gnawed bones in the corner.

 guards will ask them their names

 presumably go to johanns..
 
Sometime later the guards will come and arrest Matts character for non payment of taxes.

 If they're all in prison Bombur might turn up to offer a loan.. provided they can get it underwritten and with collateral.

 ghouls attack Johanns place at night or pfedermeister..
  One will knock on the door..  "I have a message for Johann.. or I have message for the owner of the pfedermeister"
 They will buy time while the others climb up the side of the house.
  Then that one will attack.

 New ghouls names are
 Fuad (heart) - leader middle aged man, sun bronzed man with a van dyke beard.
 Jabir (comforter) - blond man, short hair buzz cut, leather armour, short sword (which he will throw once),
 Yahya (gracious) - sullen looking, older man, skinny.  Will be left to question them.. told not to eat any of them until they've hung for a while or they'll make you ill.   Make them all very caring of one another.


 Out ... they'll carry them to a new larder and one of them on a hook, then they'll start questioning the others
 for a little bit..  Johann will be knocked out.  They'll want to go out and get more people for the rest of
 the month.  Leaving one alone with the characters.  See Lucia's questions..  They'll also see if they can


 New guards name is Pavel ... and his side kick is Rollo
 Pavel is very big, hairy blond fellow, an northerner. Wears a ruby earing.
 Rollo is lean, small, rat like man, big nose and dark hair.
