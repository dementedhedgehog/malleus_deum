MORALE - broken
TOO MANY HIT POINTS.. NOT ENOUGH CONSEQUENCES.. pull back on the refresh a bit (keep stamina as is).  Drop opening hit points a little for level 1 characters.
LACK OF EXTRA FIGHTING OPTIONS FOR FIGHTERS .. working on it.
BALANCE BROKEN .. therefore still a fair amount of fudging rules on the fly.



METTLE BROKEN

Main Problem
 Trying to do multiple things with the same mechanic...
  i) a pool for characters to power special (particularly fightery) abilities (fighters will get more of these abilities and get more mettle so this should give them
  more tactical choices in melee to balance spell casters spells).
      a) There's a number of these abilities been added recently
      b) spells that restore mettle.
  ii) a morale system for characters to reduce their efficacy if they're failing
      to try and get the battle to turn?  (e.g. making a check when you're
      bloodied).  We don't want to make this too bad to avoid death spirals and
      TPKs.
      a) Flee and Rally ability?  (Rally is a mettle check to stop fleeing..
         but fleeing is voluntary)
      b) Morale Checks Checks.. 
         This is a DC 5 Mettle Check which cascades to someone else when you fail.
	 Should trigger when you get bloodied.. but I've been lax in enforcing it.
         Currently.. if you fail morale checks, yoiu will eventually be forceed to
	 flee (after 3 fails). 2 fails and you're broken and trying to back off.
	 This is a bit strong.  All of this is in a Morale Check Fail Table.
  iii) What happens when PCs run out of Mettle.
  iv) a morale system for monsters to check to force monsters to break and run.
      when some number of monsters have died Gm determines are break test should
      be made.  If they fail then the monsters retreat.   
  v) demon instability?  monster ability.
  vi) spells that make monsters perform mettle checks or gain an effect.
      a) vox imperium (ench)
      b) tanglefoot (wild)
      c) Banish (abj)
      d) Air of Beatitude..
      e) Back! Thou Creature From the Abyss
      f) Hold/Turn/Destroy Undead
      g) Wither
      h) Mace Wild Swing
      i) Howl of the Hunt
      j) Auri Fames
      k) Spear Fend
      l) Staff - Circle of Death



*** Proposed Solution ***
 1) Separate the PC facing mechanics and keep Mettle pools for them. e.g. i and ii?
 2) Drop the break Morale Check Fail Table .. it's heavy handed, awkward, and overly complicated.  Cascading fails is enough.
 3) Add two new monster attributes: aggression and willpower.  (These are like standard abilities and players can roll against them).  




*** How we address above problems using changes ***
 i) stays the same
 ii) stays the same, drop break table.
 iii) With no mettle dice you can't do the special fightery abilities (same as you can't cast spells when you're out of magic dice).  When you have no mettle dice you fail your Morale checks and they cascade .. increasing the rate the party loses morale.
 iv) Morale checks made by monsters: GM/Players check against either aggression xor willpower **depending on encounter**.  Reduce the targeted stat after each test .. it makes sense to me for monsters to run away.. also it ends combat fast rather than dragging it out.   Also rename to Break Test.  So PCs make Morale Checks and monsters make Break Tests... (they're very different mechanics).
 v) Demon simulacrums are the projection of demons onto the prime material plane whose "bodies" are comprised of ectoplasm.  They don't have hit points per se, they have
 demon instability instead.  Magic spells will check against the demons willpower and probably reduce the willpower when they fail.  Some number of hit points done with normal weapons will count as 1 willpower damage.  The use of magic weapons will increase that amount somehow.   Probably use a similar system for spirits/ghosts.  Force a check at certain values of willpower.. e.g. 20, 15, 10, 5.   It's ok if demons are a little bit complicated.
 vi) Spells...
      a) vox imperium (Command spell) .. easy magic check to cast then check against willpower to succeed.
      b) tanglefoot (wild) .. easy magic check to cast then check agility or be slowed
      c) Banish (abj) .. against demons.  easy magic check to castperform a willpower check with some bonus, check 
      d) Air of Beatitude.. against demons and undead..  easy magic check to cast then perform a willpower check or attack the caster
      e) Back! Thou Creature From the Abyss.. Demon specific..  easy magic check to cast, decrease willpower then check willpower.
      f) Hold/Turn/Destroy Undead.. easy magic check to cast then check against willpower if successful they are held, turned, destroyed. (doesn't reduce willpower).
      g) Wither .. OLD: Std+Rank to Defence, then easy magic check to cast, does 2d8 damage, target makes mettle vs 9+Rank or loses turn!!  On paper it's hard to cast this
         spell, in practice I don't think we've been rolling the to-hit..  We may tweak the "casting" checks a little.  But the mettle vs 9+Rank will change to a
	 Std + Wither_Rank vs monsters willpower or lose their turn.
      h) Mace Wild Swing -  Monsters that get hit by this attack need to make a will power check to attack (player will roll an extra Std+Mace_Wild_Swing_Rank defensive roll before the attack).   
      i) Howl of the Hunt - magic check forces monsters to make a Break Check
      j) Auri Fames - charms target to want gold ... easy magic check to cast then check willpower or easy to bribe.
      k) Spear Fend - Opponents must make an willpower or aggression check to make melee attacks against the character. (PC gets an extra defensive check Std+Fend_Rank vs willpower or aggression)
      l) Staff - Circle of Death - similar to previous




add range to abilities
update ability graphs 

monsters .. aggression, self-control? willpower/control/composure.


Monsters don't have dice pools.
Plot Armour.

Fuzzy Terminology
break test
Routed/Broken
Morale Checks  - cascading mettle checks with a DC of 5 (if you fail someone else has to check... partly to allow for "leadership" type skills, rerolls, bonuses etc).



  - They have dcs..  Players roll against those dcs.
  - Problems here is that they may want to oppose those values with std checks as well?
  - two stage.. check to cast, check for effect?


problem with checking when you're bloodied. - easy to forget?

broken, etc..

MAKE HELD THE SAME AS BROKEN    UNDEAD AND TANGLEBRIAR?
MAKE TURNED THE SAME AS ROUTED? 
Turned (as in undead condition) forcing them to flee from the character or their allies for three rounds.. after which they will leave the area if able.

 more ghouls
 make the parlor empty.. carcasses picked clean hanging on some improvised bent steal hooks to keep them away from the rats.. gnawed bones in the corner.

 guards will ask them their names

 presumably go to johanns..
 
Sometime later the guards will come and arrest Matts character for non payment of taxes.

 If they're all in prison Bombur might turn up to offer a loan.. provided they can get it underwritten and with collateral.

 ghouls attack Johanns place at night or pfedermeister..
  One will knock on the door..  "I have a message for Johann.. or I have message for the owner of the pfedermeister"
 They will buy time while the others climb up the side of the house.
  Then that one will attack.

 New ghouls names are
 Fuad (heart) - leader middle aged man, sun bronzed man with a van dyke beard.
 Jabir (comforter) - blond man, short hair buzz cut, leather armour, short sword (which he will throw once),
 Yahya (gracious) - sullen looking, older man, skinny.  Will be left to question them.. told not to eat any of them until they've hung for a while or they'll make you ill.   Make them all very caring of one another.


 Out ... they'll carry them to a new larder and one of them on a hook, then they'll start questioning the others
 for a little bit..  Johann will be knocked out.  They'll want to go out and get more people for the rest of
 the month.  Leaving one alone with the characters.  See Lucia's questions..  They'll also see if they can


 New guards name is Pavel ... and his side kick is Rollo
 Pavel is very big, hairy blond fellow, an northerner. Wears a ruby earing.
 Rollo is lean, small, rat like man, big nose and dark hair.
