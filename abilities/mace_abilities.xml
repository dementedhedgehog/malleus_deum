	The character swings the mace wildly keeping their opponents at bay.
	When attacked the character makes a free willpower check against the first
	opponent that attacks them in a round.	If successful the opponent loses
	their attack, being unable to approach.  If the willpower check is not successful
	the character makes a free attack against the opponents defence before the opponents
	attack.

	<label>ability:mace.parry</label>
        When a character is attacked they may attempt to parry the blow using their weapon
	instead of making an armour roll.  If the parry check succeeds the attack does no damage.
	If the parry result fails and a boon is rolled the attack deals half damage.  If the parry
	result fails and a bane is rolled the attack deals double damage.
