	The mage attempts to curse the target, if successful cast the mage
	makes an opposed standard check against the targets willpower adding the spells result
	as a bonus to the check.  If successful the subject gains the <emph>Hunger for Gold</emph>
	aspect with a difficulty equal to the std check plus magic pool result.  This aspect
	lasts twenty four hours.  The use of some item of contagion from the target
	should result in a significant bonus to the Willpower check, preferably blood or hair,
	though other items may be used with the GMs discretion.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	If an overcharge occurs one or more of the following occur:
	<list>
	  <li>
	    The caster suffers from backlash and also gains the
	    <emph>Hunger for Gold</emph> aspect,
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    A minor demon of greed takes notice and projects
	    a simularcrum of themselves to the casters location.
	    The goal of the demon may be to fight the caster, 
	    make a deal with the caster either for mutual benefit
	    or by threat.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The spell nearly gets away from the caster and they must attempt
	    to assert control of the magical energies.  Reroll any remaining dice
	    used in the check after any dice have been exhausted.  On a roll of one or
	    two that die is also exhausted.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Roll on the magical overcharge table.
	  </li>

	The caster magically takes the appearance of a person, creature or thing.
	The glamour is illusiary in nature... <eg/> a character taking the form of a
	great eagle cannot fly.  The caster may take the form of a person, creature
	or thing of similar size to the character.  The DDC to break the glamour
	is the spells result versus Perception (a group check).
      </p>

      <p>
	At rank 3 and above the caster may take the form of a person, creature of
	thing of significantly (50%) larger or smaller size to the character.	    
	The difficulty of seeing through the glamour with True Sight is 25.

	The caster attempts to insinutate an idea into the targets mind.
	In order to succeed the caster must first make a check to cast
	the spell and then at the point that the idea changes the targets
	normal behaviour the caster must make a Magic check against
	the targets Willpower pool result or behave in accordance with the
	mind worm.  On overcharge the target realizes they are being
	compelled at the time the mind worm effects their behaviour.  Other
	overcharge effects might also apply (for example the caster might
	create a two-way mind worm).
