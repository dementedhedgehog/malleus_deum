      <p>
        Characters equipped with a hammer can use the hammer
	to "smash" a humanoid opponent hitting them and pushing them back.
	If the attack roll hits and is a boon the target takes double damage and is also
	knocked prone and stunned if they fail their save..
	If the attack roll hits and is a bane then the target takes half damage.
	If the attack misses and a boon is rolled then the attacker still manages to force the defender back.
	If the attack misses and a bane is rolld then the attacked must save or be knocked prone.

	On a noteworthy hit, that is any doubles roll that hits, the character does an extra
	+1d8 damage, and makes an opposed endurance check.  If successful the opponent is stunned
	(loses their Move, Minor and Reaction for the turn).
