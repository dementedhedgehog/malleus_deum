  	Banishing is an attempt to disrupt a demons tenuous contagious
	connection with its simulacrum.  If the banishment succeeds the demon must make
	a DC 7 Mettle check or its simulacrum is destroyed.  In the event of an overcharge
	make Demon must make a second DC 3 Morale Check and make a DC 15 Willpower Check
	on, a fail the caster takes 2d4 damage, on a bane make an additional roll on the
	Magic Overcharge Effects table, on a boon the character may refresh a magic dice
	into their pool, snatched from the energy the demon is using to control their

  	A circle of protection is a circle drawn upon the ground and infused
  	with magical energy that breaks the link required for thaumaturgic contagion. The
	circle can be marked using chalk, salt, enscribed in the floor or created in a
	multitude of other ways.  The circle is hard for summoned creatures to cross,
	either in either direction. A caster takes the Cast action to create the circle.
	A cicle of radius 
	<measurement><metric>3m</metric><imperial>10'</imperial></measurement> can be
	constructed in one full turn.   A circle of
	radius <measurement><metric>6m</metric><imperial>20'</imperial></measurement> 
	takes two full turns to create.
	A circle of protection cannot be created while the caster is being attacked in melee.
      </p>

      <p>
	When a demon or undead attempts to pass through the barrier the creature may be repelled and
	suffers	mettle damage.
      </p>

      <p>
	A Circle of Protection can be used keep creatures out of the circle, or to imprison the
	entities within the circle.  A circle designed to confine creatures is usually called
	a Circle of Containment.
      </p>

      <p>
	If the target or targets did not see the barrier being cast then it is possible that they
	do not perceive that it exists.  The caster can roll a

  	The character must know the name of the entity to contact.  On overcharge
  	the character must make an opposed will check against the demon or become

  	The caster uses raw magical energy to knock arrows and crossbow bolts out
  	of the air.  The caster must be aware of the attack, <ie/> not
  	ambushed or surprised.  The size of the missile that can be
  	diverted depends on the rank of the casters ability.  The missile
  	does not have to be aimed at the caster in order for the caster
  	to cast this spell.  This spell is cast as a reaction after
  	the target is hit, the caster can tell that the missile would hit
  	and acts accordingly before it does.

  	The Flesh Ward spell provides magical protection
  	for the caster against physical attacks, their skin
  	knits itself up if they take damage.  A Flesh Ward
  	lasts the duration of combat and a character can only
	have one Flesh Ward active at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
  	In game the effect of flesh ward is represented
  	in the form of a limited regeneration.  If the cast
  	succeeds, for the duration of the combat every time the character is hit
	they immediatly heal 1d4 hit-points.  If the cast overcharges the spell then the
	caster suffers damage equal to the difference between the DC and
	their roll.
