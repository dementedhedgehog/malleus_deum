	Scout is the ability to notice things that are out of
	place in the wilderness.  The character becomes aware of
	any subtle but strange changes in the environment.

        <indexentry>Traps<subentry>see Scout (Wilderness)</subentry></indexentry>
	Scout can be used to detect traps, snares, lures etc in the wilderness.
	In urban environments use the Notice ability, and use a
	Perception Check in other cases.

      <p>
	Stealth ia the ability to move silently, avoiding detection, while
	not leaving a trace of the characters passage in the wilderness.
	This ability is used to avoid being tracked.  Stealth can also
	be used for evading pursuit in the wilderness.
      </p>

      <p>
	In urban or built environments use the Sneak ability, and use an Agility Check
	in other cases.

    <abilitydescription>
      <p>
	Constructing make-shift shelters, starting fires in challenging conditions, 
	finding water, trapping and the use of snares.  Normally this is not an issue 
	for characters.  However, when the cold north winds start to howl and the 
	snow falls, when food runs low, or when alone in the burning deserts survival
	becomes	difficult and someone should test against this ability.

    <abilitydescription>
      <p>
	Tracking is the art of following trails left by others.
	It applies mainly to the wilderness but given the right 
	circumstances may be used in cities or beneath the earths 
	surface.  Tracking involves observing changes in the 
	environment caused by the individuals being tracked.  
	For example, it might be impossible to track someone 
	who had moved down a corridor unless they had just walked 
	through mud or water, or were wounded and leaving 
	a trail of blood.

    <tags><wilderness/></tags>
    <abilitydescription>
      <p>
	Wayfinding is the art of finding paths through 
	the wilderness to a destination.  Along major roads
	no check is required.  Along tracks and side paths
	this should be a fairly straight-forward test.  
	When walking through deep forest or jungle or foggy marshes
	this should be a hard test.  Possession of a map 
	or being in view of landmarks should also make the 
	test much easier.

	This ability represents knowledge of a particular biome.   The (Type)
	will be a tag that is a rather broad geographical region.  The GM
	determines available wilderness types but some suggested regions are
	The Frozen Barrens, The Blasted Deserts, The Four Seas, and the
	Lands of Civilized Men.  There should not be too many.
