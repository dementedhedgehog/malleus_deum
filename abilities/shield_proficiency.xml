	<label>ability:block</label>
        When a character is attacked they may attempt to block the blow using their shield
	instead of making an armour roll.  This ability spends the characters reaction for
	the round.  If the block result fails and a boon is rolled the attack deals half
	damage.  If the block result fails and a bane is rolled the attack deals double
	damage. If the block check succeeds the attack does no damage.  If the block succeeds
	and a boon is rolled the blocker smashes the attacker in the face with the shield for
	2 damage.

  	The character can use the shield to push an adjacent opponent
  	back in a direction chosen by the character.  The opponent must
  	be corporeal, humanoind, capable of being moved, and not too much larger
  	than the character.

  	Large shields provide <defn>Support</defn>.
  	The character wielding a large shield can use their reaction to block attacks on adjacent allies.
  	In order to use this ability the ally must be standing shoulder to shoulder
  	with the character.  In other respects this ability works like Shield Block.
