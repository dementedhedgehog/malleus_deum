        The art of communing with the unquiet dead is at best the province of shysters 
	and charlatans and at worst an art that plays with things that no man ought.  
	It's practice is viewed with disdain by all right thinking peoples.

	While holding part of the deceased's body the necromancer may ask questions of the 
	dead person.  If the spell succeeds the dead person will respond to questions 
	telepathically.  After each question roll a D4, on a 1 the link with the spirit has 
	been broken and no more questions can be asked.
      </p>

      <p>
	Answers will be heard only by the necromancer and will be heard 
	as a voice in the head.  The necromancer must ask the question in a language 
	understood by the spirit and the spirit will respond in a language they understood 
	during their lifetime.  The spirit that is contacted is under no compulsion to 
	reply and may ignore the character, lie in its responses or answer how it pleases.  
      </p>

      <p>
	The newly dead are often disorientated by their experience and may not realize that 
	they are in fact dead.  If death is sudden or traumatic a spirit may not remember 
	it.
      </p>

      <p>
	Characters may only attempt to commune with a particular dead person once.  
	Whether they succeed or fail in their first attempt they will never be 
	able to successfully commune with that person again as the things that keep the 
	gates between life and death are vigillant and fearsome.

	The caster grafts the fresh flesh of one creature onto another.
	Without the appropriate skeletal, vascular and muscular support the new
	flesh will not be usable by the subject, <eg/> you can graft
	an extra arm to a subject but they will not be able to use it.
	You can however replace an existing limb with another or
	restore a previously amputated limb.  Note that you cannot
	use this spell to replace the head of a creature.  Once decapitated
	the creature is dead.

	If successfully cast, chanting this psalm makes it hard for the undead to see and hear the
	caster.   After an attack is made against the character by an undead creature, the caster can
	make a save against that attack by making a Std+3×Rank	check against the undeads perception.
	If successful the undead creature cannot make the attack and loses their attack for that round.
	This save is a free action that happens before any defensive ability, <eg/> dodge, made by the
	caster.
