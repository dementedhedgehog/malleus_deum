	The character swings their weapon in large arcs keeping foes at bay.
	Opponents must make a Willpower check to attack and the character may
	roll to hit the first opponent who tries to do so in the round as a
	reaction.  If successful the opponent cannot close to attack.
      </p>

      <p>
	Note that this ability requires a reasonable amount of space to swing the
	weapon.

        When a character is attacked they may attempt to parry the blow using their weapon
	instead of making an armour roll.  This ability spends the characters reaction for
	the round.  If the parry result fails and a boon is rolled the attack deals half
	damage.  If the parry result fails and a bane is rolled the attack deals double
	damage. If the parry check succeeds the attack does no damage.
