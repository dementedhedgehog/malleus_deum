        <indexentry>Armour Check</indexentry>	
	After the character gets attacked they make an <defn>armour check</defn> to see if that attack
	was successfully defeated by the characters armour. If successful the character takes no damage
	from the attack.  This can be interpreted as either the armour taking the force of the blow
	and protecting the character, or the character moving in such a way that the
	the character is struck a glancing blow leaving them uninjured.
      </p>

      <p>	
	Instead of making an armour check the character may
	choose to dodge, shield block, parry or use some
	other attack-reaction ability.   Armour is not a reaction and does not use the characters
	reaction for the current turn unlike many other defence check abilities.  
      </p>

      <p>
	To make an Armour Check the modifier is calculated as follows.  First calculate the bonus
	for the type of armour worn by the character, <eg/>Plate provides +4, No armour provides +0.
	The Armour Modifier is then the Armour Rank of this ability, plus the Armour Bonus, +1 if a
	shieldis used, minus three.
      </p>

      <p>
	If the armour result fails and a boon is rolled the attack deals half damage.  If
	the armour result fails and a bane is rolled the attack deals double damage.
	If the armour check succeeds the attack does no damage.  If it fails the attack does
	normal damage.
      </p>

      <p>
	Some attacks cannot be defended with armour, <eg/> a dragons breath weapon.  If no other
	attack-reaction ability is used the attack automatically does normal damage.

      <p>
        The Charge ability allows the character to test their mettle.  If sucessful they
	may move their movement rate +1d6 in the direction of an enemy and then make an
	additional melee attack.  A character cannot Charge an enemy who is within their
	movement range as there is not enough distance to build up speed, (in that case they
	should just move and attack). If the character fails to reach their attacker
	then they must move at their full movement plus extra charge moment towards
	their foe and finish their turn in the open without attacking.  
      </p>

      <p>
	Attacks made with this ability gain the Charge tag and any rules that apply to
	such tags, such as Brace for Charge, can be used against the Charger.  Charging may
	provoke a break test in opponents at the GM's discretion.  On overcharge the character
	becomes Enraged.

	The character may attempt to dodge <emph>instead</emph> of making an armour roll.
	Doing so uses the characters reaction for the round.
	If successful the attack is dodged and the character takes no damage.
	If the dodge fails and a bane is rolled the attack does double damage.
	If the dodge fails and a boon is rolled the attack does half damage.	
      </p>

      <p>
	Some types of attack cannot be dodged, e.g. surprise attacks or
	poisonous gas attacks.  Other types of attack <eg/> the acid or 
	fire attacks of dragons may be dodgeable depending on the context
	and deal half or no damage (at the GM's discretion).

        The Flee ability allows the character to move more than twice their movement rate
	away from an enemy, fear has given them wings.  Characters who are fleeing must
	make a Rally check in the End Stage to stop fleeing.  Characters may voluntarily
	flee if there exists a credible threat, or they may be forced to flee if they
	fail a break test.  For the purposes of game play fleeing is considered to be a
	double movement <emph>+d6</emph>.  Fleeing is successful if the character is not
	damaged in the following round.  Fleeing does <emph>not</emph> trigger an attack of
	opportunity.

    <abilitydescription>
      <p>
  	Grappling involves grabbing, tackling or wrestling an opponent and holding
  	them without harming them.  Other attacks against a grappled opponent
  	are hindered by the grappler being close to the opponent and the opponents
  	struggling.
      </p>

      <p>
  	Every round that an opponent is grappled they may make an opposed Str test
  	against their grappler to escape.  Once grappled it takes a round for
  	a second character to tie-up, or otherwise constrain, the opponent.

	A head butt involves the attacker driving the top of their head into the bridge

	as a surprise attack.  An attacker may only head butt someone immediately in 
	front or behind them.  An character may head butt when grappled.
      </p>

      <p>

      <p>
	In addition, the character may make a check to go for it, and move a bit further in

	playing on a grid, or some other narrative effect during TOTM combat.  If the character
	fails their check they need to make an Agility check or suffer a bane.
