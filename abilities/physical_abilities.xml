      <p>
	This ability represents the characters ability to swim (if at all).  Everyone
	is assumed to be able to dog paddle instinctively.  Failure of this check
	means that the character is unable to make any progress.  Repeated failures
	might result in the characters having to make exhaustion or resolve checks
	as they start to panic.
