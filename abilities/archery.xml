	These abilities represent training with the use of the bow and arrow.  Initial
	training is with a short bow.  Use of the long bow requires a fair amount of
	training.

      <p>
	Holding a pair of arrows in his hand the character
	is able to shoot them both in quick succession.  Note that this involves
	less than complete drawing of the bow and therefore causes less dmg.
	Also note that the speed of these shots occurs because the character is
	holding the arrows in his firing hand before the combat, so this ability
	can only be used in the first round of combat and cannot be used when the
	character is surprised.

      <p>
	This ability allows the character to fire three arrows as one action.
	The speed of these shots occurs because the character is holding the arrows
	in his firing hand before the combat begins, so this ability can only be used in
	the first round of combat and cannot be used when the character is surprised
	or otherwise unprepared.  The character can fire a number of arrows equal to
	their rank in this ability.  The character rolls to hit for each arrow.
