        When a character is attacked they may attempt to parry the blow using their weapon
	instead of making an armour roll.  This ability spends the characters reaction for
	the round.  If the parry result fails and a boon is rolled the attack deals half
	damage.  If the parry result fails and a bane is rolled the attack deals double
	damage. If the parry check succeeds the attack does no damage.
