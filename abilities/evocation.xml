	The caster shoots a raw stream of thaumic energy from
	their hands at a target.  If successful the target may
	make a Dodge, agility, or speed check to avoid the stream.

      <p>
	If the stream hits the target the target suffers d6 damage
	and is pushed  <measurement><imperial>30'</imperial><metric>10m</metric></measurement>
	away from the caster.  If the caster hits and a benefit occurs
	roll on the overcharge effects table and apply the result to the
	<emph>target</emph>.  The caster can choose whether or not to apply
	the overcharge effect to the target or to control the magical energies
	and supress the result.

      <p>
	The character can view events from the past.  Viewing events in
	the future is incredibly difficult and unreliable (See Scry, Greater). 
      </p>

      <p>
	The caster first names a target then checks to see whether the spell
	succeeds. If it does, they see an important scene from targets life
	(the GM narrates the scene to the player). The caster may then choose
	to look far forward, forward, back or far back in time.  Each time
	the player attempts to view another scene from the targets life they
	make another check with their remaining magic pool against a DC 10.
	The caster may continue to view scenes from the targets life until they
	fail or choose to stop scrying.
      </p>

      <p>
	Contagion is very important to this spell.  A good contagious link, the
	targets blood, or hair for example, can	reduce the difficulty of this
	spell by 10!  If the caster fails any checks while scrying their contagious
	link is destroyed.

      <p>
	The character can view events from a targets present and their future as well
	as their past. 	This spell works like the lesser Scry but because the future
	is not predetermined the results are often very unreliable and inaccurate.

	The caster grabs an opponent.
	On success the caster acts as a conduit to one of the dread
	planes,	life is drained from the target.  Anything that
	increases contagion will increase damage for this spell.
	The target is momentarily transfixed (checks Will versus the casters
	successful magic roll or loses their turn).
