      <p>
	These abilities describe monsters special abilities.  Monster
	abilities can break some of the standard constraints on abilities
	as monsters do not have to level up, and we typically want their
	abilities to be simple and easy to run.

      <p>
	In game, the way this works is that whenever a demon is hit
	they make a Mettle Check and if they fail they become
	unstable the demon's connection to the simulacrum is broken and
	the simulacrum dissipates into foul smelling ooze.  A demon's
	simulacrum has no hit points per se, only a mettle pool.
