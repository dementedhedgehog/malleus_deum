      <p>
        Craft abilities involve making and building things.  Mostly these abilities
	can be used to appraise things to provide more information to the players.
	Occassionally the characters may use these abilities to actually build or design 
	something in the game.  Finally, some of them might be useful, given the right 
	context, during the Act stage of combat.

      <p>
	This ability encompases the study of the earth, mining and minerals.
	Characters with this ability have a good understanding of mineralogy and
	can identify metals, common stone types, and common greographical structures.
	The character can read and create technical maps.  Can be used to detect secret
	doors underground. At higher ranks the character gains a deep understanding of civil
	engineering, load distribution, sapping, bridge or dam building, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
	At Rank I the character understands the basics of mining.  Can identify
	precious metals and gems and value them.  At Rank II the character is adept at
	moving over rocky terrain.  If the character makes this check then no movement
	penalties apply when moving across rocky terrain during a terrain.  At Rank III
	the character can intuit depth underground.  The character can accurately estimate
	the depth they have travelled underground relative to their entry point.  At
	Rank IV the character gets a passive check to discover secret doors in stone
	(as per Masonary II).  At Rank V the character has a deep understanding of
	mine operations, economics and of structural engineering.  This makes the
	character excellent at demolition and discovering weak points in structures,
	sapping, bringing down unstable tunnels etc.
