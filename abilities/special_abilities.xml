	The character has heightened senses when fighting unseen
	opponents.  They are atuned to slight noises and minor
	air movements that give away the location of unseen attackers.
      </p>

      <p>
	When a character with Blindsight is fighting an unseen opponent
	each time they try and attack the opponent, before they roll to attack,
	they roll a Blindsight check.   If the Blindsight check is successful
	the character only suffers a -3 modifier for the rest of the encounter
	instead of the usual -6.

	Dwarves are natural sprinters.  While slow to get moving,
	and not the most agile when it comes to dodging and
	quick changes of direction, Dwarves can build up a fair
	amount of speed in a straight line over time.
	Natural Sprinters get +3 to any Speed checks made to run.
