      <p>
	The character swings their weapon in large arcs keeping foes at bay.
	Opponents must make a Willpower check to attack and the character may
	roll to hit the first opponent who tries to do so in the round as a
	reaction.  If successful the opponent cannot close to attack.
      </p>

      <p>
	Note that this ability requires a reasonable amount of space to swing the
	weapon, and it only works when the opponents are within a 180Â° arc.
