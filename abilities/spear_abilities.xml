      <p>
	The character swings their weapon in large arcs keeping foes at bay.
	Opponents must make a Mettle Check with DDC 10+Level the first time
	they declare a melee attack on a character, if they fail their attack
	fails. In addition, the character may make a Spear Strike counter attack
	as a reaction against the first opponent that tries to strike them.
      </p>

      <p>
	Note that this ability requires a reasonable amount of space to swing the
	weapon, and it only works when the opponents are within a 180Â° arc.
