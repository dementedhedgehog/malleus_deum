      <p>
	After your character makes a successful melee attack you can make a
	a Blood Frenzy Check.  If successful you enter a Blood Frenzy and
	get advantage for standard basic melee attacks.  While in a frenzy the character
	must perform a basic melee attack every turn.  If the character does
	not perform a basic melee attack in their turn or if their are no opponents left
	the character automatically recovers from their frenzy.	The character must make a
	morale check to voluntarily recover from their frenzy.
