      <p noindent="true">
  	Augury involves petitioning a deity or powerful being for
  	information or insight.  Auguries are performed by
  	interpretation of the stars, palmistry, tea leaf reading,
  	dream interpretation, use of cards, the entrails of a sacrificial
  	victim etc.  The character should choose one method per message
  	deity and use that method thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
  	The augury process follows the following steps. First, the
  	character asks a question, then they prepare the augury,
  	and finally they examine the auspicies for the answer.
      </p>

      <p>
  	When asking the question it is important that the augure
  	specify to whom they are directing their question otherwise
  	nameless eavesdroppers may respond.  Asking the question is
  	usually done in one of the old languages.  Firstly because
  	it may be easier to communicate to the entity in that language,
  	and second because it makes for good theatre.
      </p>

      <p>
  	The steps to prepare an augury depend on the method of
  	divination, but could include making a cup of tea, or
  	sacrificing someone on an alter.  The Gods are more likely
  	to answer the character if a method appropriate to the God is
  	used.
      </p>

      <p>
  	Finally, the auspices can be examined. The GM will answer the
  	characters question in a three words or less or provide no
  	response.  If the augury is unsuccessful those words may have
  	nothing to do with the question being asked.  The check is
  	made as an hidden opposed check modified by how likely it is for the god
  	to know the answer and the likelihood that the god cares enough to
  	answer. At higher ranks the character may be gifted visions as a response.
      </p>

      <p>
  	It is important to know that in Malleus Deum the Gods are
  	capricious, are not omniscient or in general, particularly caring.
  	So they may not answer the characters augury.
      </p>
      
      <p>
  	A character may keep making checks and asking questions until they
  	fail, at which point they feel they have lost the attention of the
  	god and no more attempts may be made to contact that deity for
  	next day.
