    <abilitydescription>
      <p noindent="true">
	Augury involves petitioning a deity or powerful being for
	information or insight.  Augurys are performed by
	interpretation of the stars, palmistry, tea leaf reading,
	dream interpretation, use of cards, the entrails of a sacraficial
	victim etc.  The character should choose one method per message
	recipient and use that method thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
	The augury process follows the following steps. First, the
	character asks a question, then they prepare the augury,
	and finally they examine the auspicies for the answer.
      </p>

      <p>
	When asking the question it is important that the augure
	specify to whom they are directing their question otherwise
	nameless eavesdroppers may respond.  Asking the question is
	usually done in one of the old languages.  Firstly because
	it may be easier to communicate to the entity in that language,
	and second because it makes for good theatre.	
      </p>

      <p>
	The steps to prepare an augury depend on the method of
	divination, but could include making a cup of tea, or
	sacrificing someone on an alter (players should not do this).
      </p>

      <p>
	Finally, the auspices can be examined. The GM will answer the
	characters question in a three words or less or provide no
	response.  If the augury is unsuccessful those worfs may have
	nothing to do with the question being asked.  The player gets
	to see their roll, but does not know the difficulty of the augury.
      </p>

      <p>
	It is important to know that in Malleus Deum the Gods are
	capricious,are not omniscient or in general, particularly caring.
	So they may not answer the characters augury.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	A character may keep performing auguries until they fail, at which
	point they feel they have lost the attention of the god.
