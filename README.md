# Malleus Deum

Malleus Deum is a fantasy pen and paper, tabletop, role-playing game (RPG).
It is the authors intention that *you* should be able to modify, rebuild and
or push changes you make to the rules.  However, currently the document build
is a little complex.   I suggest that you only try and edit the documents
directly if you have a good understanding of Python/Latex and Xml.

This is a work in progress.. Check out build/phb.pdf for the players handbook,
build/gmg.pdf for the Game Masters Guide.. and see build/archetypes.pdf for a
list of the archetypes (that's a class+race).

Currently running two campaigns of this game.  It plays pretty well but the
balance needs some tweaking, and the archetypes only go to level 1 at the moment.
