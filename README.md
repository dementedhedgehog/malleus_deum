# Malleus Deum

Malleus Deum is a fantasy pen and paper, tabletop, role-playing game (RPG).
It is the authors intention that *you* should be able to modify, rebuild and
or push changes you make to the rules.  However, currently the document build
is a little complex.   I suggest that you only try and edit the documents
directly if you have a good understanding of Python/Latex and Xml.
